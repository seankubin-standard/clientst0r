# Client St0r — Roadmap

> Living plan. Phases 1–6 + 9 + 31 (Vault Access Rules) complete. Phase 7 in progress (continuous track). Update as phases complete.

## Phasing principle

Foundations first — engines that *enable* downstream features. Then revenue-relevant features. Then ITIL + ecosystem + polish. Each phase is self-contained, ships incrementally via the Apply flow, and unblocks the next.

---

## Phase 1 — Contract / agreement engine deepening **(M · foundation)** [complete]

Mature contract engine — beyond the basics. Required for accurate profitability reporting (Phase 3).

- Per-contract **overage rules** — different rate for billable hours past allowance *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Role-based inclusion/exclusion** — e.g. "T1 work included, T3 work billable at $X" *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Prepaid block hours with rollover** — % rollover, expiry dates *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Auto-renewal** — N days before end_date, auto-create next period via `psa_auto_renew_contracts` cron *(1.2 — shipped v3.17.130)*
- **Proration** — mid-month start/cancel *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Bundled services** — line items per agreement via `ContractBundleItem` model with dynamic editor *(1.2 — shipped v3.17.130)*
- Agreement **profitability snapshot** — revenue vs. cost-of-delivery this period, surfaced on contract detail page *(1.2 — shipped v3.17.130)*

## Phase 2 — Resource management foundation **(M · foundation)** [complete]

Required by capacity planning, profitability-by-tech, and scheduling improvements.

- `UserSkill`, `UserCertification` models
- `WorkingHours` (per user, per weekday + per-org override)
- `Holiday` / `LeaveRequest` (PTO booking with approval)
- `BillableTarget` (hours/week per tech, used for utilization KPI)
- **Capacity report** — forecast vs. scheduled vs. actual hours per week per tech
- **Skill matching** on the dispatch board — when assigning, surface techs ranked by skill+availability

## Phase 3 — Financial reporting + BI **(L · keystone)** [complete]

Most-requested feature class. Big surface, but builds entirely on Phase 1+2 foundations.

- Canonical reporting query layer (`reports/queries.py`) — single source of truth for revenue, hours, costs *(3.1 — shipped v3.17.139)*
- **Profitability by**: client *(3.1 — shipped v3.17.139)* / contract / project / tech *(3.2 — shipped v3.17.140)* / agreement / ticket-type / closure-category
- **Effective hourly rate** report (revenue ÷ billable hours) *(3.3 — shipped v3.17.141)*
- **Revenue-leakage report** (unbilled time ≥ N days old + expired blocks + un-pushed invoices) *(3.3 — shipped v3.17.141)*
- **SLA trend report** — breach rate per client, per priority, over time *(3.4 — shipped v3.17.143)*
- **Margin analytics** by service line *(3.4 — shipped v3.17.143)*
- **Custom dashboards** — drag-and-drop widgets sourced from the canonical query layer *(3.5 — shipped v3.17.142)*
- **Scheduled reports** — cron-style, email PDF/CSV *(3.6 wave B — shipped v3.17.147)*
- **Wallboard view** — TV-ready big-number display (active tickets, breaches, MTTR, queue depth) *(3.6 wave A — shipped v3.17.146; basic 6-tile fixed layout)*
- **Configurable wallboards with widgets** *(planned)* — multiple named wallboards per org, drag-to-reorder widget grid, pick widgets from the existing dashboard widget registry (v3.17.142), per-wallboard refresh interval, "rotate through wallboards" mode for NOC TVs
- **Executive scorecard** — single page rolling 30-day MSP KPIs *(3.6 wave A — shipped v3.17.146)*
- **Client-health score** — composite of SLA hits, ticket velocity, NPS proxy, billing aging *(3.6 wave B — shipped v3.17.147)*

## Phase 4 — Procurement workflow **(L)** **— shipped**

Builds on existing distributor integrations (Ingram/Pax8/Synnex). Adds the workflow above the catalog.

- `PurchaseRequisition` → approval → `PurchaseOrder` *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- POs auto-numbered + branded PDF + email-to-vendor (mirror Quote/Invoice pattern) *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- **Receiving** — partial receive, back-orders, serial-number capture into Asset records *(4.2 — shipped v3.17.149)*
- **Vendor relationship** model — lead times, payment terms, contact preferences *(4.3 — shipped v3.17.150)*
- **Stock minimums + auto-replenish** suggestion *(4.3 — shipped v3.17.150)*
- **Drop-ship handling** — direct-to-customer flag with shipping address override *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- **Fulfillment tracking** — link POs to tickets/projects, status pipeline *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- **One-click PO from accepted quote** — converts quote line items to a draft PO *(4.4 — shipped v3.17.151)*

## Phase 5 — CRM / sales pipeline **(L)** **— complete**

A mature PSA covers sales-pipeline-to-invoice. Currently we have quotes; we need everything *before* the quote.

- `Lead`, `Opportunity`, `Campaign`, `Commission` models *(5.1 — shipped v3.17.152; 5.2 — shipped v3.17.153)*
- Lead scoring + conversion funnel report *(5.2 — shipped v3.17.153)*
- Pipeline Kanban view (Discovery → Qualified → Proposal → Closed Won/Lost) *(5.1 — shipped v3.17.152)*
- **Quote-to-project automation** — one click on accepted quote spins a Project with tasks pre-populated from quote line items *(5.1 — opportunity → quote shipped v3.17.152; quote → project deferred to Phase 7 polish backlog)*
- Sales-activity timeline per org/lead (calls, emails, meetings logged) *(5.3 — shipped v3.17.155)*
- Commission rules engine + per-tech commission report *(5.2 — shipped v3.17.153)*
- Lead capture from web form / IMAP / API *(5.3 — web + API shipped v3.17.155; IMAP poller stubbed, full implementation deferred to 5.4 follow-up)*

## Phase 6 — ITIL maturity **— complete**

Extends existing tickets + approvals; doesn't fork into a separate model layer.

- **Change requests** as a `Ticket.ticket_type='change'` extension with required CAB approval before status moves to "Implementing" *(6.1 — shipped v3.17.158)*
- **CAB workflow** — multi-approver gate (extends existing single-approval) *(6.1 — shipped v3.17.158)*
- **Problem records** — link N related tickets, root-cause analysis field, status pipeline *(6.2 — shipped v3.17.160)*
- **Release management** — group changes into release windows, freeze flags, rollback documentation *(6.3 — shipped v3.17.165)*
- **Service-catalog governance** — approval gate on catalog item changes *(6.3 — shipped v3.17.165)*
- MSP-named sample role templates seeded by `RoleTemplate.get_or_create_system_templates()`: Client, Client Admin, Technician, Tech Manager, Office Manager, Full Admin (in addition to the existing Owner/Administrator/Editor/Help Desk/IT Manager/Documentation Writer/Read-Only) *(shipped v3.17.164)*

## Phase 7 — Outsourcing, integrations, polish **(continuous track)** [in progress]

Not a single phase — runs alongside 1-6.

- **Outsourcing**: subcontractor org type, share-ticket-to-partner endpoint with HMAC, two-way sync of comments + status, optional billing markup *(shipped v3.17.166)*
- **Integration SDK**: clean provider plugin interface *(skeleton shipped v3.17.166)*; then steady drops — Datto Backup, ITGlue v2 import, Hudu sync, BackupRadar, ScreenConnect, Acronis, Liongard. Target: 5-10 new providers per quarter.
- **Polish backlog** — test coverage gaps, permission edge cases, audit improvements, mobile UI fixes, onboarding docs, import-tool maturity, API stability, third-party trust signals *(continuous track)*
  - Tenant-isolation security-test suite restored from rotted state; latent `/api/passwords/<id>/` audit-log crash fixed *(shipped v3.17.171)*
  - Removed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` / `datetime.now()` from core views; bug-report timestamp no longer mislabels server-local time as UTC *(shipped v3.17.173)*
  - Codebase-wide sweep of deprecated datetime calls; fixes tz-naive query bug in audit-log cleanup + expired-session cleanup on non-UTC servers *(shipped v3.17.174)*
  - Auto-apply-gunicorn-fix migration silenced on test runners + fresh dev installs (no longer spams "Fix script exited with code 1" banners) *(shipped v3.17.175)*
  - Defender adapter flagged as a reference stub in label + test-connection message + module docstring so operators don't pick it expecting live alert flow *(shipped v3.17.179)*
  - Silent `except Exception: pass` swallowers in `core/views.py` audit-log fallback + `core/security_views.py` scan handler tightened to log real exceptions; package-scanner JSON endpoints use a `_staff_or_superuser_api` decorator instead of inline checks *(shipped v3.17.180)*

## Phase 9 — Security alert ingestion: EDR / AV / Firewall on the dashboard **(M)** [shipped — v3.17.168]

MSPs run a stack of security tools that all alert independently — SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Defender, Sophos, Bitdefender, Webroot, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Sonicwall, etc. The PSA dashboard should aggregate alerts from all of them, surface critical issues per client, and let techs triage from one screen.

### Sub-phase 9.1 — Connection framework *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- Generic `SecurityVendorConnection` model: provider type (edr/av/firewall), org-scoped credentials (encrypted), poll interval, last_sync_at, last_error
- Provider type enums covering EDR (CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne Singularity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Sophos Central, Huntress, ThreatLocker), AV (Bitdefender GravityZone, Webroot, Malwarebytes, ESET), Firewall (Fortinet FortiGate, Palo Alto, Sonicwall, Cisco Meraki MX, Sophos XG, pfSense)
- Two-way mapping: each connection optionally pinned to a client `Organization` (multi-tenant alert routing)
- Reuses existing integration patterns (status pill from v3.17.135)

### Sub-phase 9.2 — Alert model + poller *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- `SecurityAlert` model: connection FK, external_id (dedupe key), severity (info/low/medium/high/critical), title, description, asset hint, raw_payload (JSON), seen_at, acknowledged_by, acknowledged_at, status (new/acknowledged/dismissed/resolved), auto_ticket FK (optional)
- Per-vendor poller adapters returning normalized alert dicts; one mgmt cmd `poll_security_alerts` runs every 5 min via cron
- Idempotent dedupe by (connection_id, external_id)
- Alert webhook receiver endpoint `/security/webhook/<token>/` for vendors that push (HMAC-verified)

### Sub-phase 9.3 — Dashboard + auto-ticketing *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- New "Security alerts" card on the global dashboard + per-org dashboard: count by severity in the last 24h, drill-down to filtered list, color-coded
- New page `/security/alerts/` — full triage UI; filter by severity / vendor / client / status
- Per-vendor or per-severity rule: auto-create a PSA ticket from an alert (priority mapped from severity, queue configurable, assignee from a default rule). Mirrors workflow rules engine (v3.17.111).
- Bulk "ack / dismiss / convert to ticket" actions

### Sub-phase 9.4 — Reporting *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- "Mean time to acknowledge" metric per client / per vendor
- Suppression rules (don't auto-ticket from this vendor between 22:00–06:00 etc.)
- Weekly digest email to client of unresolved alerts (opt-in) *(deferred — pending email subscription mgmt; framework + MTTA shipped)*

**Sizing:** **M** — 9.1+9.2 = 2 weeks (one reference adapter + the framework), 9.3 = 2 weeks, 9.4 = 1 week. Each new vendor adapter beyond the first is ~2-4 days. Ship the framework + 1-2 reference adapters first, then add vendors as customer demand arrives.

**Dependencies:** none. Can run alongside Phase 2 / 3 / 8.

# Long-term roadmap — Phases 10-23

The following are **planned / in-progress** items focused on MSP workflow consolidation and operational visibility. None are positioned as fully implemented. Items overlapping with already-shipped phases are noted as "Extends X" so the deltas are explicit. AI-assisted features are clearly marked **OPTIONAL AI**.

## Phase 10 — Advanced Email-to-Ticket Engine **(M)** [in progress]

**Roadmap item:** Advanced Email Processing & Ticket Intelligence. Extends the basic IMAP poller already shipped (v3.17.83+).

Planned capabilities:
- Advanced inbound email parsing (HTML + plain-text fallback) *(10.2 — shipped v3.17.177)*
- Thread reconstruction across replies + forwards *(10.1 — shipped v3.17.176)*
- Reply correlation by Message-ID + In-Reply-To headers (more reliable than current subject-regex match) *(10.1 — shipped v3.17.176)*
- Signature stripping *(10.2 — shipped v3.17.177)*
- Loop detection (ignore auto-responders) *(planned — Phase 10.3)*
- Spam scoring before ticket creation *(planned — Phase 10.3)*
- Attachment extraction with MIME-type allowlist *(10.2 — shipped v3.17.177)*
- Automatic contact association (match sender email → existing contact / membership) *(planned — Phase 10.3)*
- Per-client parsing rules *(planned — Phase 10.3)*
- Ticket categorization (rule-based) *(planned — Phase 10.3)*
- Ticket tagging
- Email security validation (SPF / DKIM / DMARC inspection) *(planned — Phase 10.3)*
- Outbound threading + per-ticket conversation panel *(planned — Phase 10.4)*
- Ticket summarization (**OPTIONAL AI**)
- Intent detection (**OPTIONAL AI**)

### Sub-phase 10.1 — Threading + Message-ID correlation *(shipped v3.17.176)*

- New `EmailMessage` model captures every inbound (and later, outbound) email's Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References, headers, and bodies. Unique per `(organization, message_id)` so cross-tenant Message-ID collisions never thread incorrectly.
- New `Ticket.last_inbound_message_id` cache feeds outbound threading in 10.4.
- Poller correlation order is now: (a) In-Reply-To against `EmailMessage.message_id` in the same org, (b) walk the References chain right-to-left, (c) subject-regex fallback (legacy tickets keep working), (d) create new ticket. Whichever path matches, the inbound message is persisted as an `EmailMessage` row so the next reply has something to chain against.
- Tests cover header-threading, References-chain walking, subject-regex fallback for legacy replies, cross-org isolation, and new-ticket creation.

### Sub-phase 10.2 — Body cleanup + attachment ingestion *(shipped v3.17.177)*

- New `psa/email_parsing.py` helper module: `sanitize_html` (bleach with tight allowlist; strips scripts, styles, iframes, inline event handlers, remote images / tracking pixels; rewrites links with `rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"`), `strip_signature` (RFC 3676 `\n-- \n` sentinel + mobile/marketing prefaces), `strip_quoted_reply` (Apple/Gmail "On … wrote:", Outlook `-----Original Message-----` / From-Sent-To-Subject block, trailing `>`-prefix block).
- Reply comments to existing tickets get sig + quoted history stripped so only the new content shows. Full original body still preserved on `EmailMessage.body_text` for the Phase 10.4 conversation panel. New tickets keep the full body so context isn't lost.
- Attachment ingestion via `_ingest_attachments`: walks parts for `Content-Disposition: attachment`, validates against `PSA_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_MIME_ALLOWLIST` (default: images, PDF, text, Office, ZIP) + `PSA_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` (default 25 MB), writes accepted files as `TicketAttachment` rows linked to the new comment. Rejected files logged at WARNING level. Filenames sanitized.
- Inbound HTML bodies are sanitized at write time before landing on `EmailMessage.body_html`.

### Sub-phase 10.3 — Routing rules + auto-responder & spam gating *(planned)*

Sender-domain → client-org auto-route, regex-driven priority/category/queue rules, vacation/NDR loop detection, SPF/DKIM/DMARC verdict gate.

### Sub-phase 10.4 — Outbound threading + conversation panel *(planned)*

Threaded outbound replies (`In-Reply-To`/`References` set from `Ticket.last_inbound_message_id`), per-ticket "Email Conversation" panel showing rendered HTML & raw headers.

## Phase 24 — Native RMM Agent + Endpoint Management **(XL — major undertaking)**

**Roadmap item:** First-party RMM stack — patch management, scripting, remote access. Today the project integrates with external RMMs via the existing integration framework; this phase adds an in-house alternative for installs that want a self-hosted RMM.

Planned capabilities:
- Lightweight cross-platform agent (Go or Python) that registers via secure token
- Endpoint inventory (CPU / RAM / disk / installed software / network state)
- **Patch management** — Windows Update / apt / yum / Homebrew push + scheduling + rollback. Extends OS Package Scanner shipped earlier.
- **Scripting / automation against endpoints** — sandboxed PowerShell / Bash / Python with audit log + approval gate for high-risk scripts
- **Remote access** — browser-launched session over WebSocket relay (no third-party agent install). Optional fallback to existing ScreenConnect / RustDesk integration.
- Health monitoring + drift detection (extends Phase 17)
- Performance metrics + alerting
- Software deployment + uninstall
- Background task queue (push command → agent ack → result back via webhook)

Dependencies: Phase 9 (security framework — auth + audit), Phase 17 (asset intelligence baselines). Significantly larger scope than other phases — likely a multi-quarter program. Recommended only if customer demand for self-hosted RMM is strong.

**Goal:** Provide a self-hosted RMM option that integrates natively with the existing PSA + asset stack instead of requiring a third-party RMM.

## Phase 25 — Mature Timesheet Approval Workflows **(M)**

**Roadmap item:** Formal time-entry approval pipeline. Today `psa.TicketTimeEntry` is logged ad-hoc by techs; there's no formal weekly approval before billing.

Planned capabilities:
- Weekly timesheet model — groups a tech's TicketTimeEntry rows for a payroll period
- Submit → review → approve / reject pipeline (reuses Phase 6.1 CAB approval pattern)
- Multi-tier approval (tech → team lead → finance)
- Per-entry rejection with note ("re-classify this billable entry as project work")
- Lock approved timesheets — entries can't be retroactively edited after approval
- Auto-reminder cron at end of payroll period for un-submitted timesheets
- Bulk-approve UI for managers
- Export approved timesheets to payroll (CSV / QuickBooks Time / Gusto)
- Audit trail per entry: who approved, when, with what note

Dependencies: extends Phase 2 (BillableTarget + utilization) + the existing approval queue pattern.

**Goal:** Add billing-grade rigor to time entries before they flow into invoices and commissions.

## Phase 26 — Custom Report Writer + Saved Queries **(L)**

**Roadmap item:** User-defined reports without writing Python. Today reports are templated (Phase 3 ships ~15 canned reports); this phase lets non-developers build their own.

Planned capabilities:
- Visual query builder — pick model (Ticket / Invoice / TimeEntry / Asset / etc), filters, group-by, aggregates, sort, limit
- Saved query model — per-org or shared
- Run as report (renders as table + auto-chart for numeric columns)
- Schedule a saved query as a recurring email-PDF (extends Phase 3.6 scheduled-reports runner)
- Pin a saved query as a dashboard widget (extends Phase 3.5 widget registry)
- Export to CSV / JSON / Excel
- SQL escape hatch for power users (gated behind a separate permission; sandboxed read-only DB connection)
- Report-template marketplace — share / import community report definitions

Dependencies: Phase 3.5 (dashboards), Phase 3.6 (scheduled reports).

**Goal:** Reduce the gap between what owners want to know and what's pre-templated.

## Phase 27 — Advanced Accounting Reconciliation **(M)**

**Roadmap item:** Deeper accounting integration than the basic invoice push that ships today (QBO + Xero — Phase shipped earlier). Adds true reconciliation between Client St0r's books and the accounting system.

Planned capabilities:
- Bidirectional payment sync — when a payment lands in QBO/Xero, mark the source Invoice as paid
- Invoice deduplication detection (catch double-pushes)
- Unpaid-vs-pushed reconciliation report (what's invoiced here but missing in QBO?)
- Per-invoice line-item mapping to GL accounts (revenue vs. cost-of-services-sold splits)
- Tax reconciliation (compare what we calculated vs. what QBO recorded)
- Accounts receivable aging tied directly back to QBO/Xero AR
- Bank-account reconciliation hooks (mark which payments matched which bank-deposit batches)
- Refund / credit-memo workflows (today only credit-charge type exists)
- Multi-entity / multi-book support for MSPs operating multiple legal entities
- Audit trail of every accounting-system interaction (req/resp pairs stored encrypted)

Dependencies: existing AccountingConnection pattern. Builds on Phase 15.

**Goal:** Eliminate manual cross-checking between Client St0r and the accounting system.

## Phase 28 — Browser Extension + Offline Vault Access **(L)**

**Roadmap item:** Chrome / Firefox / Edge extension for password autofill from the vault, plus an offline-capable PWA mode for read-access to the vault.

Planned capabilities:
- WebExtension (cross-browser via WebExtensions API)
- One-click autofill on login pages from `vault.Password` matched by URL pattern
- Master-password unlock (re-derive AES-GCM key locally; never transmit master)
- Per-organization isolation (extension UI matches the active org context in-app)
- Offline-encrypted vault cache — last-fetched passwords are stored encrypted under a session key, valid for N hours so a tech can still pull a credential when the server is unreachable
- TOTP code generation in-extension (existing `totp_secret` field on Password)
- Audit log of every autofill (logged when the extension reconnects)
- Generate-strong-password helper (matches the existing in-app generator)
- Browser-extension specific permissions on RoleTemplate (`vault_extension_use`, `vault_extension_offline_cache`)

Dependencies: existing vault model + AES-GCM key infra. Browser extension is a separate codebase + store-submission process.

**Goal:** Match the IT Glue / Bitwarden experience that techs already expect.

## Phase 29 — Commercial Operations Ecosystem **(continuous · meta)**

**Roadmap item:** Not a feature — the *commercial* support stack around the open-source product: SLAs, professional onboarding, commercial support tiers. This is the ecosystem an enterprise buyer evaluates before adopting a self-hosted MSP platform.

Planned capabilities:
- Tiered commercial support offering (Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum) with response-time SLAs
- Paid onboarding service — installation, data migration, integration setup
- Migration scripts for inbound data imports from common existing platforms (one-time imports for new customers onboarding from another tool)
- Architect-led implementation packages for installs > 50 techs
- Per-customer commercial-support portal (dedicated case queue, escalation path)
- Public status page (https://status.huduglue.example) with planned-maintenance windows
- Roadmap voting page where commercial customers can prioritize phases
- Quarterly customer advisory board
- Public security-disclosure / responsible-disclosure program with bug-bounty
- SOC 2 readiness (controls inventory + audit trail + auditor-ready evidence pack)
- Trust portal: vendor security questionnaire pre-answers, DPIA, sub-processor list
- Commercial license / EULA optionality for enterprise buyers who can't accept MIT-only
- Reseller / partner program for IT consultancies who deploy on customer premises

Dependencies: this runs alongside the technical phases — the commercial program matures with the product. Items here are not unit-testable; they're operational + organizational.

**Goal:** Provide the commercial trust signals an enterprise buyer expects on top of the open-source product.

## Phase 31 — Vault GeoIP / IP / Time Access Rules **(S)** [shipped — v3.17.163]

Per-rule GeoIP / IP / time-of-day gates on top of the vault. New `VaultAccessRule` model, scopable to a specific Password, a specific User, or an Organization (three scopes). Rules carry allowed/blocked country lists (ISO codes), allowed/blocked CIDR lists, allowed weekdays + hour window with IANA timezone, plus priority + active flag. DENY-wins-then-priority engine; empty rule set keeps back-compat ALLOW. Every reveal/view decision is audit-logged with the reason, source IP, country, and matched rule ID. New `vault_manage_access_rules` permission gate.

- `vault.VaultAccessRule` model + migration *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- Decision engine `vault/access_rules.py` reusing firewall middleware GeoIP helpers *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- CRUD UI under `/vault/access-rules/` + access-denied page *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- Detail-view badge: "N access rules apply" *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- 7 unit tests in `vault.tests.VaultAccessRuleEngineTests` *(shipped v3.17.163)*

---

## Phase 30 — Endpoint Remote Access (alternative to Phase 24) **(L)**

If Phase 24 (Native RMM) is too large to take on directly, Phase 30 is the smaller-scope remote-access-only slice that doesn't require building a full RMM agent.

Planned capabilities:
- WebSocket relay service: tech browser ↔ relay ↔ end-user agent
- Browser-only client (canvas-based VNC-over-WebSocket or RDP-relay)
- Lightweight per-endpoint helper agent (Windows / macOS / Linux) — accepts inbound relay sessions only; no scripting / no scheduling
- Recording of sessions (opt-in per client) for audit
- Per-session approval prompt on the user's screen
- Permission gates: `remote_access_view`, `remote_access_initiate`, `remote_access_record`
- Optional integration with existing ScreenConnect / RustDesk / MeshCentral (preferred for installs that already have one)

Dependencies: none direct. Strictly smaller than Phase 24.

**Goal:** Provide remote access without building a full RMM stack.

## Phase 32 — Remote Network Discovery Import **(M · future / late-stage)** [planned]

A technician opens an Organization in ClientSt0r, picks a Location, and clicks **Generate Network Discovery Script**. ClientSt0r issues a temporary one-time-use token bound to that single org + location, generates a downloadable PowerShell script, and the tech runs it on a Windows host inside the client's network. The script does a safe (non-intrusive, non-credentialed) sweep of the local subnets, collects IP / MAC / hostname / vendor data, and uploads the results back to ClientSt0r. ClientSt0r imports / updates Asset records under that Org + Location, deduping by MAC and by org+location+IP.

**Roadmap item — placed near the end of the roadmap as a future / late-stage feature.** The user request explicitly says do not turn this into an RMM agent: no persistent agents, no permanent API keys, no exploit scanning. Strictly safe, auditable, scoped, MSP-friendly network discovery.

### Models (new app, e.g. `network_discovery/`)

- **`NetworkDiscoveryToken`** — `id`, `organization` FK, `location` FK, `created_by`, `token_hash` (only the hash; full token never re-displayable), `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, `used_at`, `max_uses` (default 1), `use_count`, `source_ip_last_used`, `user_agent_last_used`, `notes`, audit timestamps.
- **`NetworkDiscoveryImport`** — `id`, `organization`, `location`, `token` FK, `uploaded_by_user`, `source_ip`, `device_count`, `imported_count`, `updated_count`, `skipped_count`, `error_count`, `raw_payload` (JSON, optional summarized form), `created_at`.
- **`NetworkDiscoveryAssetResult`** — `id`, `import` FK, `organization`, `location`, `asset` FK (nullable; set when matched / created), `ip_address`, `mac_address`, `hostname`, `vendor`, `device_type`, `discovery_method`, `status`, `raw` JSON, `created_at`.

### Endpoints

- `POST /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/generate/` — authenticated; gates on a new `network_discovery_generate` RoleTemplate boolean. Returns the script file + the one-time token displayed once on screen (never again).
- `GET /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/download/<token_id>/` — re-downloads the script (token still hidden; re-renders only the script body with the token already embedded server-side at first generation).
- `POST /api/network-discovery/upload/` — public, **token-only** auth. Token is single-use (or limited-use), short-lived, scoped to one (org, location), POST-only, write-only — cannot read anything. Validates payload size + IP/MAC/hostname formats. Rate-limited.
- `POST /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/revoke/<token_id>/` — revokes immediately.
- `GET /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/imports/` — import history.

### PowerShell script behavior

- Auto-detects active local IPv4 subnets from active network adapters
- Optional params: `-Subnet`, `-ServerUrl`, `-Token`, `-OrgId`, `-LocationId`, `-TimeoutMs`, `-MaxHosts`, `-SkipUpload`, `-OutputJsonPath`
- Default: ping sweep / `Test-Connection`, ARP table collection, optional reverse-DNS, MAC harvest from `arp -a` / `Get-NetNeighbor`
- Optional lightweight enrichment: probe ports 80 / 443 / 22 / 3389 / 445 only — for device-type classification (workstation / server / router / printer / unknown). Never destructive, never credentialed, never vulnerability scan.
- Runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7+
- Doesn't require admin unless necessary
- Always writes a local JSON summary before upload
- Shows count of discovered devices and upload result

### Asset import behavior

1. Match by MAC first.
2. If no MAC match, match by `(organization, location, ip_address)`.
3. On match: update missing fields only; never overwrite manually-entered names; bump `last_seen` / discovery metadata.
4. On no match: create a new Asset with `organization`, `location`, name = hostname → IP → MAC, `asset_type` = "Network Discovered Device" (or "Unknown Network Device"), IP, MAC, vendor, notes "Discovered by Remote Network Discovery Import".
5. Optional dry-run / preview mode.

### Security requirements

- Token is **temporary** (short expiry, default 15 min)
- Scoped to **one org + one location** only
- **Write-only** — can't read anything; only POST to the discovery upload endpoint
- **Single-use by default** (or limited-use with expiration) — `max_uses=1`, `use_count` tracked
- Server stores **only a hashed version** of the token; full plaintext shown once at generation, then never again
- Revocable from the UI
- Every generation, download, upload, import event audit-logged (user, org, location, source IP, count, errors)
- Upload endpoint rate-limited
- Payload size validated; all IP/MAC/hostname fields validated
- Generation requires existing authenticated user permissions
- The PowerShell script clearly shows the ClientSt0r server URL it will upload to but contains **no permanent credentials**

### UI

- Network Discovery section on Organization detail page (location-scoped)
- "Generate Network Discovery Script" button after a Location is picked
- Token expiration shown
- Last generated scripts list
- Revoke buttons
- Import history with imported / updated / skipped / error counts per import
- Last scan summary
- Warning banner: **"Run this only on networks you are authorized to scan."**

### Tests

Token generation; expiration; revocation; valid upload; expired token rejected; revoked token rejected; cross-org / cross-location upload rejected; duplicate MAC updates existing asset; duplicate IP/location updates existing asset; new devices create assets; unauthorized users cannot generate scripts; payload validation; rate limiting (if testable).

### Goal

Provide MSP-friendly remote network discovery without standing up a full RMM agent. Everything is **temporary, scoped, auditable**, and bound to a single org + location. Not a backdoor. Not a persistent agent.

## Phase 8 — Native mobile apps (iOS + Android) with GPS auto-time + Timeclock **(L · keystone)**

Reverses the earlier "PWA only" deferral. The combination of GPS auto-documentation + employee timeclock makes this a force-multiplier for billable-hours capture, not just a UX improvement.

Positioned last in the roadmap (v3.17.169) because it's the largest single undertaking and depends on a lot of other work being mature first — backend, scheduling, billing, and mobile app distribution all need to be in place before this phase pays off.

### Sub-phase 8.1 — Backend foundation
- `TechnicianLocation` model — append-only GPS pings (lat/lon/accuracy/timestamp/source); retention policy + per-org enable flag.
- `TimeclockEntry` model — clock-in / clock-out events with tech, organization, location, optional ticket, optional project, source (`'mobile'` / `'web'` / `'manual'`); derives a `TimeEntry` row on clock-out so existing billing rolls up unchanged.
- `ClientSiteGeofence` model — per-client polygon or radius around their physical address(es). Used to auto-detect "tech is on site" for ticket time tracking.
- REST API additions: `/api/v2/mobile/locations/`, `/api/v2/mobile/timeclock/`, `/api/v2/mobile/active-ticket/`.
- Token auth (long-lived per-device tokens stored in `MobileDevice` model with revoke-on-demand).

### Sub-phase 8.2 — GPS auto-documentation engine
- Background worker: every GPS ping with the tech "inside a client geofence" auto-starts a `TicketTimeEntry` against their currently-active ticket for that client (or creates a placeholder if no ticket open).
- On exit-geofence event: stop the time entry, write the duration, optionally prompt the tech to confirm + add notes via push notification.
- Selectable per-tech: **Always on** / **Ask first** / **Off**. Per-tech UserProfile flag.
- Audit log every auto-time event so disputed billing can be traced.

### Sub-phase 8.3 — Timeclock feature
- Web UI: Timeclock dashboard at `/timeclock/` for staff to view who's clocked in, total hours per pay period, exception flags (long shifts, missing clock-out).
- Mobile UI: prominent "Clock in / Clock out" button on the app home screen. Optional tie to the active ticket.
- Selectable per-org and per-tech: required vs optional, with vs without GPS context, separate from per-ticket time tracking.
- Payroll export — CSV per pay period, hooks for QuickBooks Time / Gusto / etc. (defer the integration; just structured export first).

### Sub-phase 8.4 — App build
- React Native (Expo SDK 51+ with EAS cloud build — revisits the earlier "no Expo accounts" rejection; required for store submission).
- Auth: Azure SSO + email/password fallback; session-token cookie not used (mobile uses long-lived bearer).
- Screens: Dashboard / My Tickets / Active Ticket / Clock In-Out / Map / Settings.
- Background location: foreground-only by default, opt-in for background; iOS "Always" permission requested only for techs who enable Always-on auto-time.
- Push notifications via FCM/APNS for ticket assignment, clock-in reminders, geofence exit prompts.

### Sub-phase 8.5 — Privacy + safeguards
- **Off-shift suppression**: GPS pings outside the tech's `WorkingHours` (Phase 2) are dropped at the API layer — never stored.
- Per-tech UI to view + delete their own location history.
- Org-admin retention policy (default: 90 days).
- Geofence-only mode: store only "entered/exited geofence X at time T", never raw lat/lon.
- Audit trail of every location-history view + export.

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 (`WorkingHours` for off-shift suppression). Recommended before Phase 3 (so timeclock data flows into utilization reporting).

**Sizing:** **L** — backend foundation 2 weeks, auto-time engine 2 weeks, timeclock UI 1-2 weeks, mobile app build 4-6 weeks, privacy hardening 1 week. ~10-13 weeks total. Sub-phase 8.1 is the first concrete deliverable and is a useful release on its own (web-only timeclock + GPS API endpoints) even before any mobile app ships.

## What's explicitly NOT in this plan

- Multi-currency beyond per-record `currency` field
- Multi-language support beyond Django i18n hooks
- ~~Native mobile apps (PWA only — per memory)~~ → **moved into Phase 8**
- Marketplace/app store
- White-label tenant branding beyond per-org logo

| 8 — Mobile apps + GPS auto-time + Timeclock | L | 10-13 weeks | Phase 2 (WorkingHours); positioned last as the largest single undertaking |

**Phases 1-6**: ~4 months of focused work at the established cadence.

**Phase 8** adds another ~2.5-3 months on top, but sub-phase 8.1 (web timeclock + GPS APIs) is shippable as a 2-week chunk well before the mobile app itself.

**Phases 10-30**: long-term operational deepening. None should be positioned as fully implemented today; each extends or adds to the foundations already shipped. Items overlapping shipped phases call out the deltas explicitly. AI-assisted features are explicitly **OPTIONAL AI** and gated by `psa_ai_enabled` (existing pattern from v3.17.125 AI Triage).

**Phase 24** is by far the largest — building a self-hosted RMM agent + patch management + scripting + remote access is a multi-quarter program. Phase 30 is the smaller "remote access only" alternative for installs that don't need full RMM.
