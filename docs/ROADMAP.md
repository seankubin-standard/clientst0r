# Client St0r — Roadmap

> Living plan. Phases 1–7 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 31 (Vault Access Rules) complete. Update as phases complete.

## Phasing principle

Foundations first — engines that *enable* downstream features. Then revenue-relevant features. Then ITIL + ecosystem + polish. Each phase is self-contained, ships incrementally via the Apply flow, and unblocks the next.

---

## Phase 1 — Contract / agreement engine deepening **(M · foundation)** [complete]

Mature contract engine — beyond the basics. Required for accurate profitability reporting (Phase 3).

- Per-contract **overage rules** — different rate for billable hours past allowance *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Role-based inclusion/exclusion** — e.g. "T1 work included, T3 work billable at $X" *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Prepaid block hours with rollover** — % rollover, expiry dates *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Auto-renewal** — N days before end_date, auto-create next period via `psa_auto_renew_contracts` cron *(1.2 — shipped v3.17.130)*
- **Proration** — mid-month start/cancel *(1.1 — shipped v3.17.126)*
- **Bundled services** — line items per agreement via `ContractBundleItem` model with dynamic editor *(1.2 — shipped v3.17.130)*
- Agreement **profitability snapshot** — revenue vs. cost-of-delivery this period, surfaced on contract detail page *(1.2 — shipped v3.17.130)*

## Phase 2 — Resource management foundation **(M · foundation)** [complete]

Required by capacity planning, profitability-by-tech, and scheduling improvements.

- `UserSkill`, `UserCertification` models
- `WorkingHours` (per user, per weekday + per-org override)
- `Holiday` / `LeaveRequest` (PTO booking with approval)
- `BillableTarget` (hours/week per tech, used for utilization KPI)
- **Capacity report** — forecast vs. scheduled vs. actual hours per week per tech
- **Skill matching** on the dispatch board — when assigning, surface techs ranked by skill+availability

## Phase 3 — Financial reporting + BI **(L · keystone)** [complete]

Most-requested feature class. Big surface, but builds entirely on Phase 1+2 foundations.

- Canonical reporting query layer (`reports/queries.py`) — single source of truth for revenue, hours, costs *(3.1 — shipped v3.17.139)*
- **Profitability by**: client *(3.1 — shipped v3.17.139)* / contract / project / tech *(3.2 — shipped v3.17.140)* / agreement / ticket-type / closure-category
- **Effective hourly rate** report (revenue ÷ billable hours) *(3.3 — shipped v3.17.141)*
- **Revenue-leakage report** (unbilled time ≥ N days old + expired blocks + un-pushed invoices) *(3.3 — shipped v3.17.141)*
- **SLA trend report** — breach rate per client, per priority, over time *(3.4 — shipped v3.17.143)*
- **Margin analytics** by service line *(3.4 — shipped v3.17.143)*
- **Custom dashboards** — drag-and-drop widgets sourced from the canonical query layer *(3.5 — shipped v3.17.142)*
- **Scheduled reports** — cron-style, email PDF/CSV *(3.6 wave B — shipped v3.17.147)*
- **Wallboard view** — TV-ready big-number display (active tickets, breaches, MTTR, queue depth) *(3.6 wave A — shipped v3.17.146; basic 6-tile fixed layout)*
- **Configurable wallboards with widgets** *(shipped v3.17.211)* — multiple named `Wallboard` rows per org via `reports.Wallboard` + `reports.WallboardWidget`, widgets sourced from the v3.17.142 `widget_sources.REGISTRY`, per-wallboard `refresh_seconds`, per-widget refresh override, "rotate through wallboards" mode at `/reports/wallboards/<pk>/rotate/` using meta-refresh redirects (no JS required — works on any TV browser). Drag-to-reorder UI deferred — admins set the `order` field via the admin interface for now
- **Executive scorecard** — single page rolling 30-day MSP KPIs *(3.6 wave A — shipped v3.17.146)*
- **Client-health score** — composite of SLA hits, ticket velocity, NPS proxy, billing aging *(3.6 wave B — shipped v3.17.147)*

## Phase 4 — Procurement workflow **(L)** **— shipped**

Builds on existing distributor integrations (Ingram/Pax8/Synnex). Adds the workflow above the catalog.

- `PurchaseRequisition` → approval → `PurchaseOrder` *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- POs auto-numbered + branded PDF + email-to-vendor (mirror Quote/Invoice pattern) *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- **Receiving** — partial receive, back-orders, serial-number capture into Asset records *(4.2 — shipped v3.17.149)*
- **Vendor relationship** model — lead times, payment terms, contact preferences *(4.3 — shipped v3.17.150)*
- **Stock minimums + auto-replenish** suggestion *(4.3 — shipped v3.17.150)*
- **Drop-ship handling** — direct-to-customer flag with shipping address override *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- **Fulfillment tracking** — link POs to tickets/projects, status pipeline *(4.1 — shipped v3.17.148)*
- **One-click PO from accepted quote** — converts quote line items to a draft PO *(4.4 — shipped v3.17.151)*

## Phase 5 — CRM / sales pipeline **(L)** **— complete**

A mature PSA covers sales-pipeline-to-invoice. Currently we have quotes; we need everything *before* the quote.

- `Lead`, `Opportunity`, `Campaign`, `Commission` models *(5.1 — shipped v3.17.152; 5.2 — shipped v3.17.153)*
- Lead scoring + conversion funnel report *(5.2 — shipped v3.17.153)*
- Pipeline Kanban view (Discovery → Qualified → Proposal → Closed Won/Lost) *(5.1 — shipped v3.17.152)*
- **Quote-to-project automation** — one click on accepted quote spins a Project with tasks pre-populated from quote line items *(5.1 — opportunity → quote shipped v3.17.152; quote → project shipped v3.17.213)*
- **Configurable wallboards.** Multi-named per-org boards, widget grid sourced from the v3.17.142 widget registry, per-wallboard refresh + per-widget override, NOC-TV rotation mode *(shipped v3.17.211; Chart.js + nav + screenshots v3.17.212; drag-to-reorder widgets v3.17.215; global / cross-tenant overview boards v3.17.216; selectable category dropdown on widgets v3.17.217; categories on tickets/revenue/at-risk sources v3.17.218; in-form widget add/delete + starter templates v3.17.220; 9 new operations / monitoring widget sources + Monitoring template v3.17.224)*
- Sales-activity timeline per org/lead (calls, emails, meetings logged) *(5.3 — shipped v3.17.155)*
- Commission rules engine + per-tech commission report *(5.2 — shipped v3.17.153)*
- Lead capture from web form / IMAP / API *(5.3 — web + API shipped v3.17.155; IMAP poller stubbed, full implementation deferred to 5.4 follow-up)*

## Phase 6 — ITIL maturity **— complete**

Extends existing tickets + approvals; doesn't fork into a separate model layer.

- **Change requests** as a `Ticket.ticket_type='change'` extension with required CAB approval before status moves to "Implementing" *(6.1 — shipped v3.17.158)*
- **CAB workflow** — multi-approver gate (extends existing single-approval) *(6.1 — shipped v3.17.158)*
- **Problem records** — link N related tickets, root-cause analysis field, status pipeline *(6.2 — shipped v3.17.160)*
- **Release management** — group changes into release windows, freeze flags, rollback documentation *(6.3 — shipped v3.17.165)*
- **Service-catalog governance** — approval gate on catalog item changes *(6.3 — shipped v3.17.165)*
- MSP-named sample role templates seeded by `RoleTemplate.get_or_create_system_templates()`: Client, Client Admin, Technician, Tech Manager, Office Manager, Full Admin (in addition to the existing Owner/Administrator/Editor/Help Desk/IT Manager/Documentation Writer/Read-Only) *(shipped v3.17.164)*

## Phase 7 — Outsourcing, integrations, polish **(continuous track)** [complete]

Not a single phase — runs alongside 1-6.

- **Outsourcing**: subcontractor org type, share-ticket-to-partner endpoint with HMAC, two-way sync of comments + status, optional billing markup *(shipped v3.17.166)*
- **Integration SDK**: clean provider plugin interface *(skeleton shipped v3.17.166)*; then steady drops — Datto Backup, ITGlue v2 import, Hudu sync, BackupRadar, ScreenConnect, Acronis, Liongard. Target: 5-10 new providers per quarter.
- **Polish backlog** — test coverage gaps, permission edge cases, audit improvements, mobile UI fixes, onboarding docs, import-tool maturity, API stability, third-party trust signals *(continuous track)*
  - Tenant-isolation security-test suite restored from rotted state; latent `/api/passwords/<id>/` audit-log crash fixed *(shipped v3.17.171)*
  - Removed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` / `datetime.now()` from core views; bug-report timestamp no longer mislabels server-local time as UTC *(shipped v3.17.173)*
  - Codebase-wide sweep of deprecated datetime calls; fixes tz-naive query bug in audit-log cleanup + expired-session cleanup on non-UTC servers *(shipped v3.17.174)*
  - Auto-apply-gunicorn-fix migration silenced on test runners + fresh dev installs (no longer spams "Fix script exited with code 1" banners) *(shipped v3.17.175)*
  - Defender adapter flagged as a reference stub in label + test-connection message + module docstring so operators don't pick it expecting live alert flow *(shipped v3.17.179)*
  - Silent `except Exception: pass` swallowers in `core/views.py` audit-log fallback + `core/security_views.py` scan handler tightened to log real exceptions; package-scanner JSON endpoints use a `_staff_or_superuser_api` decorator instead of inline checks *(shipped v3.17.180)*
  - Vault password mutation audit logging — `password_edit` + `password_delete` now write per-action AuditLog rows on success and on every failure mode (form validation, EncryptionError); 2 new tests in `vault.tests.PasswordMutationAuditTests` *(shipped v3.17.181)*
  - Phase 9 forms (Auto-Ticket Rule + Vendor Connection) rewritten with proper card-section layout, Bootstrap widget classes, copy-to-clipboard webhook helpers, "ALL must match" semantic hint on rule clauses *(shipped v3.17.182)*
  - UniFi + M365 connection forms rewritten with the same card-section layout (the only other forms using the sloppy generic field-loop pattern; audit confirmed the rest of the integration forms were already clean) *(shipped v3.17.183)*
  - Bare `except:` clauses replaced with `except Exception:` across 24 sites in 12 modules — no more accidental `SystemExit`/`KeyboardInterrupt` swallowing *(shipped v3.17.184)*
  - `core/security_views.py` inline staff-check sweep finished — all 9 endpoints now use `@_staff_or_superuser_view` (HTML) or `@_staff_or_superuser_api` (JSON) decorators; latent silent `except Exception` in `run_python_scan` also logged *(shipped v3.17.185)*
  - Documentation refresh: 8 new screenshots for Phase 9 + integration forms + the roadmap page; README updated with annotated captions; screenshot script extended with the new pages *(shipped v3.17.186)*
  - Baseline test coverage for `imports/` app — 34 tests across org-matcher fuzzy logic, ImportJob lifecycle, rollback flow (matched orgs preserved, created orgs deleted), unique-together constraints on mapping models, CSV preview helper *(shipped v3.17.187)*

  ➡ **Wave 1 closed (v3.17.171 → v3.17.187)** — every item from the original Phase 7 polish survey has been delivered or explicitly deferred (reCAPTCHA needs Google credentials; scheduler email-send is a feature gap not polish; welcome-email on member-add *was* a feature gap, **shipped v3.17.214**). Phase 7 stays `[in progress]` by design (continuous track) — the next wave will be triggered by user-reported issues + the next bug-bash audit.

  ### Wave 2 — going-from-zero baselines (v3.17.192 → ongoing)

  The audit punch-list flagged 16 apps with no test coverage. Wave 2 is a sustained pass through them. Each app gets baseline tests (model behavior, view tenant-isolation, key happy-path flows) — not feature-complete, but enough to surface latent crashes and lock down the contract going forward.

  **The pattern is paying off.** Three of the first six baselines surfaced real production bugs that had been latent for months — usually a wrong kwarg name, a stale field reference, or a `hasattr` check that doesn't catch `None`. Bugs caught:

  - `psa/tests.py` (5,465 lines / 220+ cases) split into 5 topical shards under `psa/tests/` so CI can run them under the 540s timeout. 271 tests across 5 shards, max shard 147s *(shipped v3.17.192)*
  - **`api/` baseline (11 tests across 6 classes)** — caught two real bugs: `AssetViewSet.filterset_fields` and `AssetSerializer.Meta.fields` both referenced `is_active` and `location` columns that don't exist on the Asset model. Every `/api/assets/` list and detail request 500'd. Fixed in same release *(shipped v3.17.193)*
  - **`audit/` baseline (30 tests across 7 classes)** — caught `AuditLoggingMiddleware._is_update()` crashing on POST to unresolved URLs (`hasattr(req, 'resolver_match')` returns True for None values; `None.kwargs` then raised `AttributeError`). Fixed in same release *(shipped v3.17.195)*
  - `assets/` baseline (16 tests across 6 classes) — model behavior, OrganizationManager filtering, view tenant-isolation, EquipmentModel back-reference. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.196)*
  - `monitoring/` baseline (22 tests across 5 classes) — WebsiteMonitor + Expiration property logic, IPAM `(subnet, ip_address)` unique-together dedupe contract, `for_organization()` filtering. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.197)*
  - `processes/` baseline (19 tests across 4 classes) — workflow engine slug auto-gen, ProcessExecution lifecycle, completion-percentage math (incl. zero-stages safety), `(execution, stage)` unique-together. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.199)*
  - `files/` baseline (9 tests across 2 classes) — `attachment_upload_path()` enforces per-org / per-entity directory structure with UUID filenames (filesystem tenant-isolation contract). No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.200)*
  - `scheduling/` baseline (20 tests across 5 classes) — recurrence math for every cadence, `check_completion` any-of vs all-of sign-off, `spawn_next_occurrence` clones assignments + tags. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.201)*
  - `locations/` baseline (20 tests across 3 classes) — HQ-uniqueness invariant, shared-location ACL, `full_address` formatting, WAN bandwidth display. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.202)*
  - `docs/` baseline (13 tests across 5 classes) — Document slug auto-gen, version-snapshot lifecycle (no row on first save, increments on edit), Diagram slug, `is_global` cross-tenant KB. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.203)*
  - `inventory/` baseline (15 tests across 5 classes) — InventoryItem QR-code auto-gen, low-stock boundary, total_value math, transaction signed-quantity formatting. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.204)*
  - `vehicles/` baseline (18 tests across 3 classes) — ServiceVehicle expiry warnings, `has_location` flag, `update_location()` setter, fleet inventory low-stock + needs-restock + total-value. No production bugs surfaced *(shipped v3.17.205)*

  ➡ **Wave 2 closed (v3.17.192 → v3.17.205)** — every one of the 16 originally-untested apps now has baseline coverage. **Final ratio: 3 of 11 baseline efforts surfaced real production bugs that had been latent for months** (api/, audit/, the v3.17.171 tenant-isolation rebuild before the wave formally started). All bugs caught were stale-attribute / wrong-kwarg / hasattr-vs-None patterns — the same family the next wave should look for first.

  Wave 2 totals: ~280 new tests across 11 modules in 14 commits. Combined with the v3.17.192 psa-tests shard split, the project's test runtime now fits comfortably under any reasonable CI ceiling: each shard ≤ 147s, smaller apps ≤ 7s.

  ✅ **Phase 7 marked complete at v3.17.207.** All three pillars have shipped: outsourcing (v3.17.166), Integration SDK skeleton (v3.17.166) + first reference adapter (v3.17.168), and the polish-backlog test-coverage push (Waves 1 + 2). Ongoing polish continues as routine maintenance — bug fixes, deprecation sweeps, new vendor adapters in the SDK — but it's no longer tracked as an active phase. Future polish lands as standalone releases under whatever phase the change applies to (e.g. a vault-side improvement = Phase 31 polish).

## Phase 9 — Security alert ingestion: EDR / AV / Firewall on the dashboard **(M)** [shipped — v3.17.168]

MSPs run a stack of security tools that all alert independently — SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Defender, Sophos, Bitdefender, Webroot, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Sonicwall, etc. The PSA dashboard should aggregate alerts from all of them, surface critical issues per client, and let techs triage from one screen.

### Sub-phase 9.1 — Connection framework *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- Generic `SecurityVendorConnection` model: provider type (edr/av/firewall), org-scoped credentials (encrypted), poll interval, last_sync_at, last_error
- Provider type enums covering EDR (CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne Singularity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Sophos Central, Huntress, ThreatLocker), AV (Bitdefender GravityZone, Webroot, Malwarebytes, ESET), Firewall (Fortinet FortiGate, Palo Alto, Sonicwall, Cisco Meraki MX, Sophos XG, pfSense)
- Two-way mapping: each connection optionally pinned to a client `Organization` (multi-tenant alert routing)
- Reuses existing integration patterns (status pill from v3.17.135)

### Sub-phase 9.2 — Alert model + poller *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- `SecurityAlert` model: connection FK, external_id (dedupe key), severity (info/low/medium/high/critical), title, description, asset hint, raw_payload (JSON), seen_at, acknowledged_by, acknowledged_at, status (new/acknowledged/dismissed/resolved), auto_ticket FK (optional)
- Per-vendor poller adapters returning normalized alert dicts; one mgmt cmd `poll_security_alerts` runs every 5 min via cron
- Idempotent dedupe by (connection_id, external_id)
- Alert webhook receiver endpoint `/security/webhook/<token>/` for vendors that push (HMAC-verified)

### Sub-phase 9.3 — Dashboard + auto-ticketing *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- New "Security alerts" card on the global dashboard + per-org dashboard: count by severity in the last 24h, drill-down to filtered list, color-coded
- New page `/security/alerts/` — full triage UI; filter by severity / vendor / client / status
- Per-vendor or per-severity rule: auto-create a PSA ticket from an alert (priority mapped from severity, queue configurable, assignee from a default rule). Mirrors workflow rules engine (v3.17.111).
- Bulk "ack / dismiss / convert to ticket" actions

### Sub-phase 9.4 — Reporting *(shipped v3.17.168)*

- "Mean time to acknowledge" metric per client / per vendor
- Suppression rules (don't auto-ticket from this vendor between 22:00–06:00 etc.)
- Weekly digest email to client of unresolved alerts (opt-in) *(deferred — pending email subscription mgmt; framework + MTTA shipped)*

**Sizing:** **M** — 9.1+9.2 = 2 weeks (one reference adapter + the framework), 9.3 = 2 weeks, 9.4 = 1 week. Each new vendor adapter beyond the first is ~2-4 days. Ship the framework + 1-2 reference adapters first, then add vendors as customer demand arrives.

**Dependencies:** none. Can run alongside Phase 2 / 3 / 8.

# Long-term roadmap — Phases 10-23

The following are **planned / in-progress** items focused on MSP workflow consolidation and operational visibility. None are positioned as fully implemented. Items overlapping with already-shipped phases are noted as "Extends X" so the deltas are explicit. AI-assisted features are clearly marked **OPTIONAL AI**.

## Phase 10 — Advanced Email-to-Ticket Engine **(M)** [complete]

**Roadmap item:** Advanced Email Processing & Ticket Intelligence. Extends the basic IMAP poller already shipped (v3.17.83+).

Planned capabilities:
- Advanced inbound email parsing (HTML + plain-text fallback) *(10.2 — shipped v3.17.177)*
- Thread reconstruction across replies + forwards *(10.1 — shipped v3.17.176)*
- Reply correlation by Message-ID + In-Reply-To headers (more reliable than current subject-regex match) *(10.1 — shipped v3.17.176)*
- Signature stripping *(10.2 — shipped v3.17.177)*
- Loop detection (ignore auto-responders) *(10.3 — shipped v3.17.188)*
- Spam scoring before ticket creation *(10.3 — shipped v3.17.188)*
- Attachment extraction with MIME-type allowlist *(10.2 — shipped v3.17.177)*
- Automatic contact association (match sender email → existing contact / membership) *(planned — Phase 10.3.1)*
- Per-client parsing rules *(10.3 — shipped v3.17.188 via EmailRoutingRule)*
- Ticket categorization (rule-based) *(10.3 — shipped v3.17.188 via routing rule queue/priority overrides)*
- Ticket tagging
- Email security validation (SPF / DKIM / DMARC inspection) *(10.3 — shipped v3.17.188; opt-in via enforce_dmarc)*
- Outbound threading + per-ticket conversation panel *(10.4 — shipped v3.17.189)*
- Ticket summarization (**OPTIONAL AI**)
- Intent detection (**OPTIONAL AI**)

### Sub-phase 10.1 — Threading + Message-ID correlation *(shipped v3.17.176)*

- New `EmailMessage` model captures every inbound (and later, outbound) email's Message-ID, In-Reply-To, References, headers, and bodies. Unique per `(organization, message_id)` so cross-tenant Message-ID collisions never thread incorrectly.
- New `Ticket.last_inbound_message_id` cache feeds outbound threading in 10.4.
- Poller correlation order is now: (a) In-Reply-To against `EmailMessage.message_id` in the same org, (b) walk the References chain right-to-left, (c) subject-regex fallback (legacy tickets keep working), (d) create new ticket. Whichever path matches, the inbound message is persisted as an `EmailMessage` row so the next reply has something to chain against.
- Tests cover header-threading, References-chain walking, subject-regex fallback for legacy replies, cross-org isolation, and new-ticket creation.

### Sub-phase 10.2 — Body cleanup + attachment ingestion *(shipped v3.17.177)*

- New `psa/email_parsing.py` helper module: `sanitize_html` (bleach with tight allowlist; strips scripts, styles, iframes, inline event handlers, remote images / tracking pixels; rewrites links with `rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"`), `strip_signature` (RFC 3676 `\n-- \n` sentinel + mobile/marketing prefaces), `strip_quoted_reply` (Apple/Gmail "On … wrote:", Outlook `-----Original Message-----` / From-Sent-To-Subject block, trailing `>`-prefix block).
- Reply comments to existing tickets get sig + quoted history stripped so only the new content shows. Full original body still preserved on `EmailMessage.body_text` for the Phase 10.4 conversation panel. New tickets keep the full body so context isn't lost.
- Attachment ingestion via `_ingest_attachments`: walks parts for `Content-Disposition: attachment`, validates against `PSA_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_MIME_ALLOWLIST` (default: images, PDF, text, Office, ZIP) + `PSA_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` (default 25 MB), writes accepted files as `TicketAttachment` rows linked to the new comment. Rejected files logged at WARNING level. Filenames sanitized.
- Inbound HTML bodies are sanitized at write time before landing on `EmailMessage.body_html`.

### Sub-phase 10.3 — Routing rules + auto-responder & spam gating *(shipped v3.17.188)*

- New `EmailRoutingRule` model with sender-domain glob matching (exact `acme.com`, subdomain `*.acme.com`, full-email `noreply@acme.com`); MSP's generic `help@msp.com` mailbox now fans inbound mail to the right client tenant + queue + priority. First match wins, ordered by `order` (lower fires first).
- Auto-responder detection via `detect_auto_responder()` — `Auto-Submitted`, `X-Autoreply`, `Precedence: bulk/list/junk`, NDR `multipart/report`, plus subject heuristics for "Out of Office" / "Vacation Auto-Reply" / "Undeliverable".
- DMARC verdict gate — opt-in per-config (`enforce_dmarc`); reads upstream MTA's `Authentication-Results` header; no inline crypto / DNS.
- Spam-keyword scorer — opt-in per-config (`spam_keyword_threshold > 0`); conservative pattern list (claim-your-prize, congratulations-winner, nigerian-prince, etc.).
- Quarantined inbound persists with `was_quarantined=True` + reason but NEVER creates a ticket; admins triage via Django admin.
- 16 new tests across 6 classes covering all four gates plus routing rule end-to-end.

### Sub-phase 10.4 — Outbound threading + conversation panel *(shipped v3.17.189)*

- New `psa/email_outbound.py::send_threaded_reply()` helper — generates Message-ID, sets `In-Reply-To` + `References` from `Ticket.last_inbound_message_id`, sends via Django email backend with optional HTML alternative, persists `EmailMessage(direction='out')` row so future replies thread back via 10.1's `_thread_target` (closing the round-trip).
- New per-ticket conversation view at `/psa/t/<ticket_number>/conversation/` — chronological inbound + outbound rows, HTML bodies rendered in `<iframe sandbox="">` (most-restrictive sandbox), quarantined-inbound shown with reason banner, raw headers/body collapse into `<details>`.
- 9 new tests covering threading headers, round-trip closure, HTML alternative, missing recipients, conversation view ACL.

**Goal:** Reduce dispatcher and technician overhead while improving ticket workflow accuracy.

## Phase 11 — Advanced Dispatch & Technician Scheduling **(M)** [complete]

**Roadmap item:** Dispatch Optimization & Technician Coordination. Extends Phase 2 (resourcing) + the dispatch board (v3.17.112) + skill ranking (v3.17.138).

Planned capabilities:
- Drag/drop dispatch board *(shipped — v3.17.112)*
- Technician scheduling *(partial — Phase 2 WorkingHours shipped)*
- Shift management
- PTO conflict awareness *(11.2 — shipped v3.17.208; extends Phase 2.2 LeaveRequest)*
- Calendar conflict detection *(11.2 — shipped v3.17.208)*
- Recurring onsite scheduling *(deferred — handled by `scheduling.ScheduledTask` recurrence; not a separate dispatch surface)*
- Dispatch prioritization (auto-rank queue by SLA + priority) *(11.1 — shipped v3.17.194)*
- SLA-aware dispatching — SLA-burn panel for tickets due ≤ 4h *(11.1 — shipped v3.17.194)*
- Technician utilization metrics *(shipped — Phase 2.3 capacity report)*
- Geo-aware technician routing *(deferred — needs GPS data on User + Ticket which Phase 8 mobile timeclock will provide; revisit then)*
- Travel time estimation *(deferred — pending Phase 8 GPS data)*
- Dispatch heatmaps *(11.3 — shipped v3.17.209)*

### Sub-phase 11.1 — Dispatch prioritization + SLA-burn panel *(shipped v3.17.194)*

- New `_dispatch_priority_key(ticket)` returns `(priority.sort_order, no_due_flag, due)` — every lane on the dispatch board (overdue, SLA-burn, unassigned-by-day, assigned-tech cells) now sorts most-urgent first.
- New "SLA at risk" panel above the grid: open tickets due in the next 4 hours but not yet overdue, surfaced with a yellow fire icon. Already-overdue stays in the existing red panel — no duplication. Closed tickets excluded.
- 9 new tests across 3 classes covering sort-key contract, panel filtering, and end-to-end lane ordering.

### Sub-phase 11.2 — PTO + calendar conflict awareness *(shipped v3.17.208)*

- New `_dispatch_conflicts(tech, ticket)` helper returns advisory warnings: **PTO conflict** (approved `resourcing.LeaveRequest` covering the ticket's due date) + **calendar overlap** (another open ticket assigned to the same tech with a due date inside a ±2-hour window).
- `/psa/dispatch/assign/` JSON response now carries a `conflict_warnings` array. Advisory, not blocking — dispatchers made an explicit decision; the warning surfaces as a chip for review. AuditLog includes the conflict list so post-hoc trails capture "they assigned despite the warning".
- 9 new tests across 2 classes covering pure-function conflict detection + end-to-end JSON response shape.

### Sub-phase 11.3 — Dispatch heatmap *(shipped v3.17.209)*

- New `/psa/dispatch/heatmap/` — per-tech, per-day open-ticket load over a ±7-day window (15 columns), rendered as a color-intensity grid so dispatchers see lopsided assignments at a glance.
- 5-step intensity scale (0..4) bucketized against the busiest cell in the visible window; today's column has a blue inset border.
- Counts open assigned tickets with due dates in window; tenant-isolated.
- Geo-aware routing + travel-time estimation **deferred** — they need GPS data the Phase 8 mobile timeclock will collect; revisit then.
- 8 new tests in `DispatchHeatmapTests` covering the view, window calculation, what's counted vs filtered, max-count math, and tenant isolation.

✅ **Phase 11 marked complete at v3.17.210.** All three planned sub-phases shipped (11.1 dispatch prioritization + SLA-burn, 11.2 PTO + calendar conflict awareness, 11.3 heatmap). 27 dispatch tests across the three sub-phases. Two listed capabilities — geo-aware technician routing and travel time estimation — were deferred to Phase 8 because they depend on GPS data the mobile timeclock will collect; revisit them in that phase rather than blocking Phase 11 closure on infrastructure that doesn't exist yet.

**Goal:** Improve technician coordination and service workflow efficiency.

## Phase 12 — Customer Communication Workflows **(M)** [in progress]

**Roadmap item:** Enhanced Client Communication & Portal Workflows. Extends the existing customer portal.

- Automatic asset linking (heuristic — same subnet, same rack, etc.)
- Infrastructure dependency chains
- Rack relationship visualization *(partial — racks already shipped)*
- Service relationship tracking ("Email service depends on Exchange Online + DNS X + Connector Y")
- Documentation inheritance (child sites inherit parent SOPs)

**Goal:** Improve infrastructure visibility and operational context awareness.

## Phase 17 — Advanced Asset Intelligence **(L)**

**Roadmap item:** Asset Intelligence & Infrastructure Visibility.

Planned capabilities:
- Asset drift detection (compare current state vs. last-known baseline)
- Baseline comparison
- Software compliance auditing
- Hardware lifecycle scoring (composite — see Phase 13)

## Phase 20 — Approval & Change Management Workflows **(M)**

**Roadmap item:** Approval Routing & Change Management. Extends Phase 6.1 (CAB) + the existing approvals queue.

Planned capabilities:
- Multi-stage approvals (sequential gates: tech lead → manager → CAB)
- Change advisory workflows *(shipped — Phase 6.1 CAB)*
- Quote approval routing (gate quotes above threshold)
- Financial approval chains (POs / invoices over $X)

- Conditional approvals (rules: "if value > $5k, route to owner")
- Approval audit trails *(partial — single-approver audit shipped)*
- Workflow enforcement
- Change tracking
- Operational sign-off workflows

**Goal:** Improve workflow accountability and operational governance.

## Phase 21 — Advanced Mobile Technician Workflows **(L)**

**Roadmap item:** Mobile Technician Workflow Expansion. Extends Phase 8 (mobile apps + GPS auto-time + Timeclock).

Planned capabilities:
- Offline workflow support (work without connectivity, sync on reconnect)
- Camera uploads (photo upload from the phone, attached to the ticket)
- Barcode scanning *(partial — vehicle inventory QR shipped)*
- QR scanning *(partial — same; extends to client-asset QR scan)*

- Technician signatures (canvas signature pad on completion)
- Onsite checklist enforcement (must complete X before close)
- Push notifications *(planned — Phase 8.4)*
- Voice-to-ticket workflows
- Mobile dispatch routing (turn-by-turn from current GPS to next ticket)
- Mobile asset lookup
- **Site check-in / check-out (Field Mode)** — explicit "I have arrived" / "I have left" buttons against the active ticket, separate from the generic Timeclock — gives per-ticket onsite-duration evidence for billing
- **Mileage and trip logging** — auto-distance from previous geofence to current geofence, plus manual override; rolls up into per-tech / per-org mileage reports
- **Quick asset edit from phone** — beyond lookup, lets a tech update serial / location / notes inline without leaving the ticket

**Goal:** Improve field technician workflow efficiency and mobility.

## Phase 22 — Knowledge Base & SOP Management **(M)**

**Roadmap item:** Knowledge Base & Operational Documentation Expansion. Extends Phase v3.17.128 (KB tree) + v3.17.134 (KB perms).

Planned capabilities:
- Knowledge base versioning (history of edits, rollback)
- Article approvals (review-before-publish gate)
- Article ownership

- CVE-to-ticket workflows
- Security incident timelines
- Exposure scoring
- Incident SLA tracking
- Automated remediation workflows
- Security dashboarding *(planned — Phase 9.3)*

- CrowdStrike
- Microsoft security ecosystem (Defender, Sentinel)
- Sophos
- Other security platforms

**Goal:** Improve operational security visibility and incident response workflows.

## Phase 24 — Native RMM Agent + Endpoint Management **(XL — major undertaking)**

**Roadmap item:** First-party RMM stack — patch management, scripting, remote access. Today the project integrates with external RMMs via the existing integration framework; this phase adds an in-house alternative for installs that want a self-hosted RMM.

Planned capabilities:
- Lightweight cross-platform agent (Go or Python) that registers via secure token
- Endpoint inventory (CPU / RAM / disk / installed software / network state)
- **Patch management** — Windows Update / apt / yum / Homebrew push + scheduling + rollback. Extends OS Package Scanner shipped earlier.
- **Scripting / automation against endpoints** — sandboxed PowerShell / Bash / Python with audit log + approval gate for high-risk scripts
- **Remote access** — browser-launched session over WebSocket relay (no third-party agent install). Optional fallback to existing ScreenConnect / RustDesk integration.
- Health monitoring + drift detection (extends Phase 17)
- Performance metrics + alerting
- Software deployment + uninstall
- Background task queue (push command → agent ack → result back via webhook)

Dependencies: Phase 9 (security framework — auth + audit), Phase 17 (asset intelligence baselines). Significantly larger scope than other phases — likely a multi-quarter program. Recommended only if customer demand for self-hosted RMM is strong.

**Goal:** Provide a self-hosted RMM option that integrates natively with the existing PSA + asset stack instead of requiring a third-party RMM.

## Phase 25 — Mature Timesheet Approval Workflows **(M)**

**Roadmap item:** Formal time-entry approval pipeline. Today `psa.TicketTimeEntry` is logged ad-hoc by techs; there's no formal weekly approval before billing.

Planned capabilities:
- Weekly timesheet model — groups a tech's TicketTimeEntry rows for a payroll period
- Submit → review → approve / reject pipeline (reuses Phase 6.1 CAB approval pattern)
- Multi-tier approval (tech → team lead → finance)
- Per-entry rejection with note ("re-classify this billable entry as project work")
- Lock approved timesheets — entries can't be retroactively edited after approval
- Auto-reminder cron at end of payroll period for un-submitted timesheets
- Bulk-approve UI for managers
- Export approved timesheets to payroll (CSV / QuickBooks Time / Gusto)
- Audit trail per entry: who approved, when, with what note

Dependencies: extends Phase 2 (BillableTarget + utilization) + the existing approval queue pattern.

**Goal:** Add billing-grade rigor to time entries before they flow into invoices and commissions.

## Phase 26 — Custom Report Writer + Saved Queries **(L)**

**Roadmap item:** User-defined reports without writing Python. Today reports are templated (Phase 3 ships ~15 canned reports); this phase lets non-developers build their own.

Planned capabilities:
- Visual query builder — pick model (Ticket / Invoice / TimeEntry / Asset / etc), filters, group-by, aggregates, sort, limit
- Saved query model — per-org or shared
- Run as report (renders as table + auto-chart for numeric columns)
- Schedule a saved query as a recurring email-PDF (extends Phase 3.6 scheduled-reports runner)
- Pin a saved query as a dashboard widget (extends Phase 3.5 widget registry)
- Export to CSV / JSON / Excel
- SQL escape hatch for power users (gated behind a separate permission; sandboxed read-only DB connection)
- Report-template marketplace — share / import community report definitions

Dependencies: Phase 3.5 (dashboards), Phase 3.6 (scheduled reports).

**Goal:** Reduce the gap between what owners want to know and what's pre-templated.

## Phase 27 — Advanced Accounting Reconciliation **(M)**

**Roadmap item:** Deeper accounting integration than the basic invoice push that ships today (QBO + Xero — Phase shipped earlier). Adds true reconciliation between Client St0r's books and the accounting system.

Planned capabilities:
- Bidirectional payment sync — when a payment lands in QBO/Xero, mark the source Invoice as paid
- Invoice deduplication detection (catch double-pushes)
- Unpaid-vs-pushed reconciliation report (what's invoiced here but missing in QBO?)
- Per-invoice line-item mapping to GL accounts (revenue vs. cost-of-services-sold splits)
- Tax reconciliation (compare what we calculated vs. what QBO recorded)
- Accounts receivable aging tied directly back to QBO/Xero AR
- Bank-account reconciliation hooks (mark which payments matched which bank-deposit batches)
- Refund / credit-memo workflows (today only credit-charge type exists)
- Multi-entity / multi-book support for MSPs operating multiple legal entities
- Audit trail of every accounting-system interaction (req/resp pairs stored encrypted)

Dependencies: existing AccountingConnection pattern. Builds on Phase 15.

**Goal:** Eliminate manual cross-checking between Client St0r and the accounting system.

Cross-references: Phase 36 (Agreement Reconciliation) layers an MSP-specific reconciliation flow — included-vs-billable labor, over/under-served clients, pre-invoice approval — on top of the GL-level reconciliation this phase covers.

## Phase 28 — Browser Extension + Offline Vault Access **(L)**

**Roadmap item:** Chrome / Firefox / Edge extension for password autofill from the vault, plus an offline-capable PWA mode for read-access to the vault.

Planned capabilities:
- WebExtension (cross-browser via WebExtensions API)
- One-click autofill on login pages from `vault.Password` matched by URL pattern
- Master-password unlock (re-derive AES-GCM key locally; never transmit master)
- Per-organization isolation (extension UI matches the active org context in-app)
- Offline-encrypted vault cache — last-fetched passwords are stored encrypted under a session key, valid for N hours so a tech can still pull a credential when the server is unreachable
- TOTP code generation in-extension (existing `totp_secret` field on Password)
- Audit log of every autofill (logged when the extension reconnects)
- Generate-strong-password helper (matches the existing in-app generator)
- Browser-extension specific permissions on RoleTemplate (`vault_extension_use`, `vault_extension_offline_cache`)

Dependencies: existing vault model + AES-GCM key infra. Browser extension is a separate codebase + store-submission process.

**Goal:** Match the IT Glue / Bitwarden experience that techs already expect.

## Phase 29 — Commercial Operations Ecosystem **(continuous · meta)**

**Roadmap item:** Not a feature — the *commercial* support stack around the open-source product: SLAs, professional onboarding, commercial support tiers. This is the ecosystem an enterprise buyer evaluates before adopting a self-hosted MSP platform.

Planned capabilities:
- Tiered commercial support offering (Bronze / Silver / Gold / Platinum) with response-time SLAs
- Paid onboarding service — installation, data migration, integration setup
- Migration scripts for inbound data imports from common existing platforms (one-time imports for new customers onboarding from another tool)
- Architect-led implementation packages for installs > 50 techs
- Per-customer commercial-support portal (dedicated case queue, escalation path)
- Public status page (https://status.huduglue.example) with planned-maintenance windows
- Roadmap voting page where commercial customers can prioritize phases
- Quarterly customer advisory board
- Public security-disclosure / responsible-disclosure program with bug-bounty
- SOC 2 readiness (controls inventory + audit trail + auditor-ready evidence pack)
- Trust portal: vendor security questionnaire pre-answers, DPIA, sub-processor list
- Commercial license / EULA optionality for enterprise buyers who can't accept MIT-only
- Reseller / partner program for IT consultancies who deploy on customer premises

Dependencies: this runs alongside the technical phases — the commercial program matures with the product. Items here are not unit-testable; they're operational + organizational.

**Goal:** Provide the commercial trust signals an enterprise buyer expects on top of the open-source product.

## Phase 31 — Vault GeoIP / IP / Time Access Rules **(S)** [shipped — v3.17.163]

Per-rule GeoIP / IP / time-of-day gates on top of the vault. New `VaultAccessRule` model, scopable to a specific Password, a specific User, or an Organization (three scopes). Rules carry allowed/blocked country lists (ISO codes), allowed/blocked CIDR lists, allowed weekdays + hour window with IANA timezone, plus priority + active flag. DENY-wins-then-priority engine; empty rule set keeps back-compat ALLOW. Every reveal/view decision is audit-logged with the reason, source IP, country, and matched rule ID. New `vault_manage_access_rules` permission gate.

- `vault.VaultAccessRule` model + migration *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- Decision engine `vault/access_rules.py` reusing firewall middleware GeoIP helpers *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- CRUD UI under `/vault/access-rules/` + access-denied page *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- Detail-view badge: "N access rules apply" *(shipped v3.17.163)*
- 7 unit tests in `vault.tests.VaultAccessRuleEngineTests` *(shipped v3.17.163)*

---

## Phase 30 — Endpoint Remote Access (alternative to Phase 24) **(L)**

If Phase 24 (Native RMM) is too large to take on directly, Phase 30 is the smaller-scope remote-access-only slice that doesn't require building a full RMM agent.

Planned capabilities:
- WebSocket relay service: tech browser ↔ relay ↔ end-user agent
- Browser-only client (canvas-based VNC-over-WebSocket or RDP-relay)
- Lightweight per-endpoint helper agent (Windows / macOS / Linux) — accepts inbound relay sessions only; no scripting / no scheduling
- Recording of sessions (opt-in per client) for audit
- Per-session approval prompt on the user's screen
- Permission gates: `remote_access_view`, `remote_access_initiate`, `remote_access_record`
- Optional integration with existing ScreenConnect / RustDesk / MeshCentral (preferred for installs that already have one)

Dependencies: none direct. Strictly smaller than Phase 24.

**Goal:** Provide remote access without building a full RMM stack.

## Phase 32 — Remote Network Discovery Import **(M · future / late-stage)** [planned]

A technician opens an Organization in ClientSt0r, picks a Location, and clicks **Generate Network Discovery Script**. ClientSt0r issues a temporary one-time-use token bound to that single org + location, generates a downloadable PowerShell script, and the tech runs it on a Windows host inside the client's network. The script does a safe (non-intrusive, non-credentialed) sweep of the local subnets, collects IP / MAC / hostname / vendor data, and uploads the results back to ClientSt0r. ClientSt0r imports / updates Asset records under that Org + Location, deduping by MAC and by org+location+IP.

**Roadmap item — placed near the end of the roadmap as a future / late-stage feature.** The user request explicitly says do not turn this into an RMM agent: no persistent agents, no permanent API keys, no exploit scanning. Strictly safe, auditable, scoped, MSP-friendly network discovery.

### Models (new app, e.g. `network_discovery/`)

- **`NetworkDiscoveryToken`** — `id`, `organization` FK, `location` FK, `created_by`, `token_hash` (only the hash; full token never re-displayable), `expires_at`, `revoked_at`, `used_at`, `max_uses` (default 1), `use_count`, `source_ip_last_used`, `user_agent_last_used`, `notes`, audit timestamps.
- **`NetworkDiscoveryImport`** — `id`, `organization`, `location`, `token` FK, `uploaded_by_user`, `source_ip`, `device_count`, `imported_count`, `updated_count`, `skipped_count`, `error_count`, `raw_payload` (JSON, optional summarized form), `created_at`.
- **`NetworkDiscoveryAssetResult`** — `id`, `import` FK, `organization`, `location`, `asset` FK (nullable; set when matched / created), `ip_address`, `mac_address`, `hostname`, `vendor`, `device_type`, `discovery_method`, `status`, `raw` JSON, `created_at`.

### Endpoints

- `POST /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/generate/` — authenticated; gates on a new `network_discovery_generate` RoleTemplate boolean. Returns the script file + the one-time token displayed once on screen (never again).
- `GET /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/download/<token_id>/` — re-downloads the script (token still hidden; re-renders only the script body with the token already embedded server-side at first generation).
- `POST /api/network-discovery/upload/` — public, **token-only** auth. Token is single-use (or limited-use), short-lived, scoped to one (org, location), POST-only, write-only — cannot read anything. Validates payload size + IP/MAC/hostname formats. Rate-limited.
- `POST /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/revoke/<token_id>/` — revokes immediately.
- `GET /orgs/<org_id>/locations/<location_id>/network-discovery/imports/` — import history.

### PowerShell script behavior

- Auto-detects active local IPv4 subnets from active network adapters
- Optional params: `-Subnet`, `-ServerUrl`, `-Token`, `-OrgId`, `-LocationId`, `-TimeoutMs`, `-MaxHosts`, `-SkipUpload`, `-OutputJsonPath`
- Default: ping sweep / `Test-Connection`, ARP table collection, optional reverse-DNS, MAC harvest from `arp -a` / `Get-NetNeighbor`
- Optional lightweight enrichment: probe ports 80 / 443 / 22 / 3389 / 445 only — for device-type classification (workstation / server / router / printer / unknown). Never destructive, never credentialed, never vulnerability scan.
- Runs on Windows PowerShell 5.1+ and PowerShell 7+
- Doesn't require admin unless necessary
- Always writes a local JSON summary before upload
- Shows count of discovered devices and upload result

### Asset import behavior

1. Match by MAC first.
2. If no MAC match, match by `(organization, location, ip_address)`.
3. On match: update missing fields only; never overwrite manually-entered names; bump `last_seen` / discovery metadata.
4. On no match: create a new Asset with `organization`, `location`, name = hostname → IP → MAC, `asset_type` = "Network Discovered Device" (or "Unknown Network Device"), IP, MAC, vendor, notes "Discovered by Remote Network Discovery Import".
5. Optional dry-run / preview mode.

### Security requirements

- Token is **temporary** (short expiry, default 15 min)
- Scoped to **one org + one location** only
- **Write-only** — can't read anything; only POST to the discovery upload endpoint
- **Single-use by default** (or limited-use with expiration) — `max_uses=1`, `use_count` tracked
- Server stores **only a hashed version** of the token; full plaintext shown once at generation, then never again
- Revocable from the UI
- Every generation, download, upload, import event audit-logged (user, org, location, source IP, count, errors)
- Upload endpoint rate-limited
- Payload size validated; all IP/MAC/hostname fields validated
- Generation requires existing authenticated user permissions
- The PowerShell script clearly shows the ClientSt0r server URL it will upload to but contains **no permanent credentials**

### UI

- Network Discovery section on Organization detail page (location-scoped)
- "Generate Network Discovery Script" button after a Location is picked
- Token expiration shown
- Last generated scripts list
- Revoke buttons
- Import history with imported / updated / skipped / error counts per import
- Last scan summary
- Warning banner: **"Run this only on networks you are authorized to scan."**

### Tests

Token generation; expiration; revocation; valid upload; expired token rejected; revoked token rejected; cross-org / cross-location upload rejected; duplicate MAC updates existing asset; duplicate IP/location updates existing asset; new devices create assets; unauthorized users cannot generate scripts; payload validation; rate limiting (if testable).

### Goal

Provide MSP-friendly remote network discovery without standing up a full RMM agent. Everything is **temporary, scoped, auditable**, and bound to a single org + location. Not a backdoor. Not a persistent agent.

Phase 33 layers the deeper, persistent / scheduled, multi-protocol discovery on top of this single-shot foundation.

---

## Phase 33 — Network Discovery & Auto Documentation **(L)** [planned]

Multi-protocol persistent network discovery and topology inference. Phase 32 ships a one-shot, scoped, single-use ping / ARP script — useful for the first walk-through of a new client. Phase 33 is the always-on companion: a lightweight per-site collector that polls SNMP / LLDP / CDP / ARP on a schedule, keeps the asset inventory current, and generates topology diagrams without manual draw-time.

Planned capabilities:
- **Lightweight site collector / agent** — one per client site, packaged as a small container or systemd unit. Pulls config from server, pushes results back. No persistent admin credentials embedded; uses a per-site rotating token similar to Phase 32's scheme.
- SNMP, ICMP, ARP, LLDP, CDP discovery
- Automatic device inventory import *(extends the single-shot Phase 32 import flow)*
- Auto-generated topology maps *(extends Phase 16 Documentation Relationship Mapping with a dedicated network-layer view)*
- Device relationship mapping (which switches connect which APs / endpoints)
- Switch port / MAC / IP correlation table (resolve "which port is this device on" per VLAN)
- Manual and scheduled scans (cron-driven background jobs; on-demand trigger from the UI)
- Per-client and per-location discovery keys (rotation + revocation, audit log)

Dependencies: Phase 32 (token + import models — extend rather than replace), Phase 16 (relationship graph rendering), Asset model.

**Goal:** Reduce manual network documentation work — keep the topology, switch port assignments, and device inventory in sync with reality without a tech having to redraw or re-export anything.

## Phase 34 — Network Configuration Backup **(M)** [planned]

Versioned configuration backup for firewalls, switches, routers, and other manageable network gear. Treats device configs the same way the existing `Document` versioning treats KB articles — every change snapshotted, diffable, alertable.

Planned capabilities:
- **Firewall, switch, and router config backup** — pulled via SSH / SCP / SNMP / vendor APIs depending on device. Per-device adapter pattern matching the integration framework shipped in Phase 7.
- Scheduled backup jobs (per-device cadence; default daily)
- Config diff viewer — line-level diff between any two snapshots; latest-vs-prior on the device detail page by default
- Alert on unauthorized config changes — diff against the last "approved" snapshot; surfaces in the security-alerts dashboard (Phase 9) when something changes outside of an approved change window (Phase 6.1 CAB)
- Firmware / version tracking — captures running firmware version on each backup so EOL transitions are visible
- End-of-life and warranty metadata fields on the device record (extends Phase 13 lifecycle tracking)

Dependencies: Phase 33 (device inventory provides the target list), Phase 9 (alert framework for drift notifications), Phase 6.1 (CAB / change-window awareness for "unauthorized" classification).

**Goal:** Eliminate the manual config-export-and-store-in-a-folder routine. Make unauthorized changes loud.

## Phase 35 — Advanced Project Management **(L)** [planned]

Mature the existing `psa.Project` and `psa.ProjectTask` models *(quote-to-project automation shipped v3.17.213)* into a full delivery management feature.

Planned capabilities:
- **Project templates** — predefined task lists for common project types (server migration, M365 cutover, network refresh). Drop a template onto a new project to populate the work breakdown in one click.
- Project phases and milestones *(milestones partial — `ProjectTask.is_milestone` flag exists)*
- Project budget tracking — hours budget + dollar budget vs. actuals
- Project profitability *(extends Phase 3.2 contract profitability with project-scoped breakdown)*
- Project-to-ticket task generation *(partial — quote line items already become ProjectTasks per v3.17.213; this phase makes any ProjectTask spawnable as a Ticket on demand)*
- Project billing support — project-bundled invoice generation, fixed-fee vs. T&M handling, milestone billing triggers
- Gantt / calendar-style planning view — drag-to-reschedule task bars on a timeline, dependency arrows between tasks

Dependencies: existing `psa.Project` + `psa.ProjectTask` models, Phase 3 (profitability infra), Phase 1 (contract / billing engine).

**Goal:** Take the lightweight Project model from "lets you group tickets" to "actually runs delivery engagements end-to-end."

## Phase 36 — Agreement Reconciliation & Pre-Invoice Approval **(M)** [in progress]

MSP-specific reconciliation between what an agreement covers and what's actually being consumed. Phase 27 handles GL-level reconciliation against QBO/Xero; this phase handles agreement-vs-labor reconciliation against the contract itself, plus an explicit pre-invoice review gate so nothing goes out the door without a human nod.

Planned capabilities:
- **Recurring agreement billing review** — monthly (or per-cycle) review screen that lists every agreement, included-hours bucket consumed, overage hours, and the draft invoice *(partial — per-contract consumption table shipped v3.17.225 at /reports/agreement-reconciliation/)*
- **Included vs billable labor reconciliation** — every TicketTimeEntry classified as "covered by agreement" / "billable on top" based on the agreement type; misclassifications flagged for review
- **Over-serviced / under-serviced client alerts** — if a client consistently uses < 30% of included hours (under-served = upsell signal) or > 130% of included hours 3 months running (over-served = re-quote signal), alert the account manager *(shipped v3.17.225 — surfaced as status badges + summary counts on the reconciliation page; recurring-pattern detection across multiple periods deferred to v2)*
- **Agreement profitability reports** *(extends Phase 3.2 contract profitability with per-agreement P&L; cost-of-labor at tech rate vs. contracted revenue)*
- **Pre-invoice approval workflow** *(extends Phase 20 approval routing — gate any draft invoice over $X or with > Y% overage on a manager queue before sending)* *(shipped v3.17.228 — `Invoice.flag_for_approval` + `Invoice.approve` + `/psa/invoices/<pk>/approve/` endpoint + push-to-accounting blocked while pending)*
- **Revenue leakage detection expansion** *(extends the existing `revenue_leakage` query that powers the `unbilled_hours` widget; adds aging buckets, per-tech leakage attribution, and a per-client leakage trend)*

Dependencies: Phase 1 (contract engine — `Contract`, `ContractBundle`, `ContractBundleItem`), Phase 15 (recurring billing automation), Phase 20 (approval routing).

**Goal:** Stop money walking out the door. Make every agreement's profitability and consumption visible before invoicing, not after.

## Phase 37 — Vault Approval & Break-Glass Workflow **(M)** [planned]

Per-credential approval gates and emergency-access ("break-glass") flow for the password vault. Phase 31 *(shipped v3.17.163)* provides geo / IP / time-window restrictions; this phase adds workflow restrictions on top.

Planned capabilities:
- **Require approval before revealing sensitive vault entries** — flag a `vault.Password` row as "requires approval"; reveal triggers an in-app approval request to the assigned approver(s); revealed only on accept; auto-expires
- **Emergency break-glass access** — bypass the approval gate with a mandatory written justification ("production down, on-call paging") + auto-notification to admin chain
- **Manager / admin notifications** — every reveal request, every approve, every break-glass event emits an in-app notification + optional email
- **Full access audit trail** *(extends the per-action vault audit shipped v3.17.181 — reveal events join the existing edit/delete events)*
- **Optional client-level vault approval rules** — for client-portal users with vault access, the client's own admin approves rather than the MSP

Dependencies: Phase 31 (`vault.VaultAccessRule` infra — extend rather than replace), Phase 20 (approval routing engine).

**Goal:** Make sensitive credentials require explicit human authorization to reveal, while preserving a documented escape hatch for genuine emergencies.

## Phase 38 — Client Onboarding / Offboarding Runbooks **(M)** [in progress]

Repeatable runbooks for client onboarding, employee onboarding/offboarding, and client termination. Each runbook is a structured checklist with verification steps and ticket-spawning hooks. Builds on the existing `processes/` workflow engine.

Planned capabilities:
- **Repeatable onboarding templates** — clone an `is_template=True` Process per new client; copies all stages with linked entities preserved *(shipped v3.17.223)*
- **Employee onboarding / offboarding workflows** *(category support shipped — `onboarding` / `offboarding` already existed; `client_*` companions added v3.17.223)*
- **Client termination checklist** — `client_termination` category added so the existing Process model carries the termination flow *(category shipped v3.17.223)*
- **Access removal verification** — for offboarding, mechanically verify that the user is actually removed from each documented system (poll vault, M365, RMM, etc.) and surface any orphaned access
- **Documentation completion scoring** — per-execution `ProcessExecution.completion_percentage` already shipped; per-org dashboard with rollup across all in-flight runbooks at `/processes/dashboard/` *(shipped v3.17.227)*
- **Runbook-to-ticket conversion** — any runbook step can spawn a Ticket; created ticket is recorded on `ProcessStageCompletion.spawned_ticket` *(shipped v3.17.223)*

Dependencies: `processes/` app (existing), Phase 14 (visual workflow builder for runbook editing).

**Goal:** Turn ad-hoc tribal-knowledge onboarding/offboarding into a measurable, repeatable, completable workflow.

## Phase 39 — Compliance Evidence Packs **(M)** [in progress]

One-click exportable audit packet per client. Bundles the evidence regulators / auditors / cyber-insurance underwriters consistently ask for, sourced from data already living in Client St0r — no manual screenshot-and-paste required.

Planned capabilities:
- **Exportable client audit packet** — single styled HTML page (with print-to-PDF stylesheet) + downloadable ZIP of per-section CSVs *(shipped v3.17.222)*
- 2FA status — which users on the account have 2FA enrolled, by method *(shipped v3.17.222)*
- User access report — current memberships, role templates, last-login per user *(shipped v3.17.222)*
- Password access history *(extends vault audit shipped v3.17.181 — every reveal / edit / delete event in the period)* *(shipped v3.17.222 — last 90 days)*
- Asset inventory — current asset list with serial / vendor / location / lifecycle stage *(shipped v3.17.222)*
- Vulnerability scan summary *(extends Phase 9 security framework + the existing OS Package Scanner)* *(shipped v3.17.226 — 90-day open-alert summary by severity)*
- SSL / domain expiration summary *(extends the WebsiteMonitor expiration infra)* *(shipped v3.17.226)*
- Ticket / SLA history — ticket counts, SLA-met percentages, response and resolution medians *(shipped v3.17.222 — 12-month window)*
- Backup and uptime evidence — backup-job success rate, monitor uptime percentages over the period *(uptime shipped v3.17.226; backup is a placeholder until a backup-tracking integration is built)*

Dependencies: Phase 9 (security data), vault, monitoring/, psa (SLA history), assets.

**Goal:** Reduce the "audit prep" interrupt to a button-press. The data is already in the system; this phase wraps it in the standardized export shape auditors expect.

## Phase 40 — Public / Client-Facing Status Page **(M)** [planned]

Public or per-client-private status page surfacing current service status, scheduled maintenance, incident history, and uptime. Sourced from the WebsiteMonitor + ticket-incident infrastructure already in place.

Planned capabilities:
- **Client-visible service status** — green / degraded / outage indicator per service the MSP runs for the client; sourced from the existing monitoring app + recent incident tickets
- **Maintenance windows** — scheduled-maintenance posts with start/end + affected services; scheduled in advance so the page shows them as upcoming
- **Incident history** — each incident is a ticket with `is_status_page = True`; rendered as a timeline with updates, root cause, and resolution
- **Uptime history** — 30 / 90 / 365 day uptime percentage per monitored service, sourced from `WebsiteMonitor` history
- **Optional per-client private status pages** — each client gets their own URL gated by client-portal auth; alternative: a single fully-public page for MSPs that want to broadcast status to all customers + prospects

Dependencies: `monitoring/` app (uptime data), `psa.Ticket` (incident history with new `is_status_page` flag).

**Goal:** Take the "is anything broken?" call volume out of the queue by giving clients somewhere to look first.

## Phase 8 — Native mobile apps (iOS + Android) with GPS auto-time + Timeclock **(L · keystone)**

Reverses the earlier "PWA only" deferral. The combination of GPS auto-documentation + employee timeclock makes this a force-multiplier for billable-hours capture, not just a UX improvement.

Positioned last in the roadmap (v3.17.169) because it's the largest single undertaking and depends on a lot of other work being mature first — backend, scheduling, billing, and mobile app distribution all need to be in place before this phase pays off.

### Sub-phase 8.1 — Backend foundation
- `TechnicianLocation` model — append-only GPS pings (lat/lon/accuracy/timestamp/source); retention policy + per-org enable flag.
- `TimeclockEntry` model — clock-in / clock-out events with tech, organization, location, optional ticket, optional project, source (`'mobile'` / `'web'` / `'manual'`); derives a `TimeEntry` row on clock-out so existing billing rolls up unchanged.
- `ClientSiteGeofence` model — per-client polygon or radius around their physical address(es). Used to auto-detect "tech is on site" for ticket time tracking.
- REST API additions: `/api/v2/mobile/locations/`, `/api/v2/mobile/timeclock/`, `/api/v2/mobile/active-ticket/`.
- Token auth (long-lived per-device tokens stored in `MobileDevice` model with revoke-on-demand).

### Sub-phase 8.2 — GPS auto-documentation engine
- Background worker: every GPS ping with the tech "inside a client geofence" auto-starts a `TicketTimeEntry` against their currently-active ticket for that client (or creates a placeholder if no ticket open).
- On exit-geofence event: stop the time entry, write the duration, optionally prompt the tech to confirm + add notes via push notification.
- Selectable per-tech: **Always on** / **Ask first** / **Off**. Per-tech UserProfile flag.
- Audit log every auto-time event so disputed billing can be traced.

### Sub-phase 8.3 — Timeclock feature
- Web UI: Timeclock dashboard at `/timeclock/` for staff to view who's clocked in, total hours per pay period, exception flags (long shifts, missing clock-out).
- Mobile UI: prominent "Clock in / Clock out" button on the app home screen. Optional tie to the active ticket.
- Selectable per-org and per-tech: required vs optional, with vs without GPS context, separate from per-ticket time tracking.
- Payroll export — CSV per pay period, hooks for QuickBooks Time / Gusto / etc. (defer the integration; just structured export first).

### Sub-phase 8.4 — App build
- React Native (Expo SDK 51+ with EAS cloud build — revisits the earlier "no Expo accounts" rejection; required for store submission).
- Auth: Azure SSO + email/password fallback; session-token cookie not used (mobile uses long-lived bearer).
- Screens: Dashboard / My Tickets / Active Ticket / Clock In-Out / Map / Settings.
- Background location: foreground-only by default, opt-in for background; iOS "Always" permission requested only for techs who enable Always-on auto-time.
- Push notifications via FCM/APNS for ticket assignment, clock-in reminders, geofence exit prompts.

### Sub-phase 8.5 — Privacy + safeguards
- **Off-shift suppression**: GPS pings outside the tech's `WorkingHours` (Phase 2) are dropped at the API layer — never stored.
- Per-tech UI to view + delete their own location history.
- Org-admin retention policy (default: 90 days).
- Geofence-only mode: store only "entered/exited geofence X at time T", never raw lat/lon.
- Audit trail of every location-history view + export.

**Dependencies:** Phase 2 (`WorkingHours` for off-shift suppression). Recommended before Phase 3 (so timeclock data flows into utilization reporting).

**Sizing:** **L** — backend foundation 2 weeks, auto-time engine 2 weeks, timeclock UI 1-2 weeks, mobile app build 4-6 weeks, privacy hardening 1 week. ~10-13 weeks total. Sub-phase 8.1 is the first concrete deliverable and is a useful release on its own (web-only timeclock + GPS API endpoints) even before any mobile app ships.

## What's explicitly NOT in this plan

- Multi-currency beyond per-record `currency` field
- Multi-language support beyond Django i18n hooks
- ~~Native mobile apps (PWA only — per memory)~~ → **moved into Phase 8**
- Marketplace/app store
- White-label tenant branding beyond per-org logo

| 8 — Mobile apps + GPS auto-time + Timeclock | L | 10-13 weeks | Phase 2 (WorkingHours); positioned last as the largest single undertaking |

**Phases 1-6**: ~4 months of focused work at the established cadence.

**Phase 8** adds another ~2.5-3 months on top, but sub-phase 8.1 (web timeclock + GPS APIs) is shippable as a 2-week chunk well before the mobile app itself.

**Phases 10-30**: long-term operational deepening. None should be positioned as fully implemented today; each extends or adds to the foundations already shipped. Items overlapping shipped phases call out the deltas explicitly. AI-assisted features are explicitly **OPTIONAL AI** and gated by `psa_ai_enabled` (existing pattern from v3.17.125 AI Triage).

**Phase 24** is by far the largest — building a self-hosted RMM agent + patch management + scripting + remote access is a multi-quarter program. Phase 30 is the smaller "remote access only" alternative for installs that don't need full RMM.
