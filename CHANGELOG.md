## [3.17.186] - 2026-05-01

### Documentation
- **Documentation refreshed with annotated screenshots for the recent polish wave.**
  - `scripts/generate_screenshots_v2.py` extended with 8 new pages: Phase 9 surfaces (`security-alerts-list`, `security-alerts-connections`, `security-alerts-connection-new`, `security-alerts-rules`, `security-alerts-rule-new`) capturing the v3.17.182 form polish; `integrations-unifi-new` + `integrations-m365-new` capturing the v3.17.183 form polish; and a `roadmap` capture of the in-app `/core/roadmap/` page.
  - **8 new PNGs** committed to `docs/screenshots/`. **16 existing PNGs refreshed** as a side effect of running the script against current live data (PSA ticket lists, dashboards, organizations, etc. have all shifted since the last capture run on 2026-04-29).
  - **README updated** with three new gallery sections, each with descriptive captions explaining what the screenshot shows: "🛡️ Security Alert Ingestion (Phase 9, forms polished v3.17.182)", "🔌 Integration Connection Forms (polished v3.17.183)", "🗺️ Live Roadmap". The bottom "View All Screenshots" detail block also got matching entries.
  - **Stale version badge** at the top of the README updated from v3.17.143 → v3.17.185.
  - Total screenshot count in README: 46 → 60+.
- The polished-form screenshots show the new card-based section layout with proper Bootstrap form-control widgets (replacing the old generic `{% for field in form %}` loops with hand-rolled inline `<style>`). The "Install Client St0r" PWA install prompt overlays a small portion of some captures — pre-existing system behavior, doesn't obscure the form structure.

## [3.17.185] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **Finished the `core/security_views.py` inline-check sweep started in v3.17.180.** The remaining 7 endpoints in the package + Python scanners (`package_scanner_dashboard`, `scan_detail`, `get_dashboard_widget_data`, `python_scanner_dashboard`, `run_python_scan`, `python_scan_detail`, `get_python_scanner_widget_data`) all carried duplicated `if not (request.user.is_superuser or request.user.is_staff):` guards. Now use either:
  - `@_staff_or_superuser_view` (HTML pages — flash + redirect) — new decorator paired alongside the existing `_staff_or_superuser_api`. 4 page endpoints converted.
  - `@_staff_or_superuser_api` (JSON endpoints — 403 JSON) — 3 endpoints converted.
- All 9 staff/superuser endpoints in the file now use the same decorator pattern. `remediate_python_package` keeps its stricter superuser-only check (running pip-install commands needs a tighter gate than staff).
- **Found another silent `except Exception` in passing.** `run_python_scan`'s outer catch returned a generic "Scan failed" 500 with no signal — same shape as the bug fixed for `run_package_scan` in v3.17.180. Now logs the real exception via `logger.exception('Manual Python package scan failed')` before returning the same response.

### Tests
- `core.tests` 10/10 in 31s. All package-scanner endpoints import-checked.

## [3.17.184] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Bare `except:` clauses replaced with `except Exception:` across the codebase** (Phase 7 polish — 24 sites). A bare `except:` clause catches `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` along with normal exceptions, which is almost always wrong: it can prevent a developer from killing a hung command with Ctrl-C, and can swallow genuine system-shutdown signals during graceful termination. Each site was spot-checked first to confirm the catch was defensive (optional imports of missing apps in org-merge, font-loading fallback in diagram previews, datetime parsing of vendor strings, subprocess errors during apt-cache update) — none were intentionally targeting `SystemExit`. Sites:
  - `accounts/views.py` — 6 sites in the org-merge flow (defensive imports of optional apps: Devices / Contacts / Documents / Tickets / RMMConnection / PSAConnection)
  - `config/settings.py:322` — defensive socket inspection during dev settings
  - `core/management/commands/scan_system_packages.py` — 3 sites around `apt-get update` subprocess fallback
  - `core/search_views.py:99, 110` — search-result decode fallback
  - `core/settings_views.py:640` — settings-import fallback
  - `core/updater.py:231` — version-check fallback
  - `core/views.py:962, 1306` — view-handler fallbacks
  - `docs/management/commands/generate_diagram_previews.py:89` — image-generation fallback
  - `docs/services/ai_documentation_generator.py:658` — AI-response parse fallback
  - `docs/utils.py:44, 113` — `ImageFont.truetype()` font-load fallback
  - `integrations/providers/psa/rangermsp.py:464, 474` — vendor API parse fallback
  - `integrations/providers/rmm/datto.py:381` — `datetime.strptime` parse fallback
  - `locations/views.py:102` — geo-import fallback
- Behavior preserved: `ImportError`, `OSError`, `ValueError`, `subprocess.CalledProcessError` etc. are all `Exception` subclasses, so the new `except Exception:` still catches everything the old code did. The sites that need *narrower* catches (e.g. `except (TimeoutExpired, FileNotFoundError):`) are tracked as a separate polish item — this release is a uniform safety improvement, not a per-site narrowing.

### Tests
- 48/48 across `accounts`, `core.tests`, `integrations`, `docs` — no regressions. Each touched module also import-checked individually.

## [3.17.183] - 2026-05-01

### Changed — Form polish round 2
- **UniFi + M365 connection forms cleaned up.** Audit after v3.17.182 found the same sloppy pattern (generic `{% for field in form %}` flat loops with no section grouping) on two more integration forms.
  - **`templates/integrations/unifi_form.html`** — full rewrite. Card-based layout with three sections: Identity (name + mode + active toggle), Controller endpoint (host + verify_ssl, only relevant in self-hosted mode), Credentials (api_key always; username + password as "optional self-hosted extras" with explanation that they unlock WLAN/VLAN/firewall data). Existing JS that toggles self-hosted-only fields when mode=cloud is preserved. The setup-guide sidebar (self-hosted + cloud variants) is preserved with FontAwesome icons in the headers. Required-field asterisks added (only on creation; on edit credentials are optional).
  - **`templates/integrations/m365_form.html`** — full rewrite. Card-based layout with two sections: Tenant identity (name + tenant_id + active toggle), App registration credentials (client_id + client_secret side-by-side). Setup-guide sidebar preserved.
- **Audit clean:** other integration forms (`omada_form.html`, `grandstream_form.html`, `rmm_form.html`, `distributor_form.html`, `accounting_form.html`, `integration_form.html`, `psa_form.html`) already use explicit field rendering — not affected. `templates/docs/template_form.html`'s inline `<style>` block is for the WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE / Quill), not form-control faking — left alone. `templates/locations/location_form.html` only uses the for-loop for error aggregation; the form fields are properly tabbed and explicit — left alone.

## [3.17.182] - 2026-05-01

### Changed — UX polish on Phase 9 forms
- **Auto-Ticket Rule and Vendor Connection forms cleaned up** (user-reported sloppy layout). Both pages were minimal generic field loops with hand-rolled inline `<style>` blocks doing manual form-control styling that didn't match the rest of the project.
  - **`security_alerts/forms.py`** — every widget now declares its Bootstrap class (`form-control` / `form-select` / `form-check-input`) explicitly. Several fields gained inline placeholders so empty fields show the expected shape (e.g. `priority code → "P1 / P2 / P3 / P4"`, `match_provider → "e.g. security_defender (blank = any provider)"`).
  - **`templates/security_alerts/connection_form.html`** — full rewrite. Card-based layout with four sections: Identity (name + provider + category + client), Endpoint & credentials (base URL + encrypted credentials blob), Polling & activity (interval + active/sync toggles as form-switches), Notes. Webhook setup callout (when editing) now shows the URL and HMAC secret with one-click copy buttons. Required-field asterisks added.
  - **`templates/security_alerts/rule_form.html`** — full rewrite. Card-based layout with five sections: Identity (name + priority + active toggle), Match clauses (provider + category + min severity + client, with an "ALL must match" badge to make the AND-semantics obvious), Action (action type + queue + priority code + assignee), Suppression window (with a "leave blank to never suppress" hint), Notes.
  - Both forms now have proper "Back to list" buttons in the header, breadcrumbs, and the form-control classes come from widgets so the inline `<style>` blocks are gone.
- **Tests:** `security_alerts.tests` 9/9 passing; templates parse clean.

## [3.17.181] - 2026-05-01

### Added
- **Vault password mutations now audit-logged** (Phase 7 polish — survey item #9). Vault edit/delete views previously logged reads (read access via `password_detail`/`password_reveal`, gated by VaultAccessRule since v3.17.163) but mutations slipped through unaudited. Now `password_edit` writes an AuditLog row on success (with the list of changed fields), on form validation failure (with the error keys), and on `EncryptionError` (with the error message). `password_delete` writes a row capturing the title BEFORE the delete so post-delete forensics still show what was removed. All use `success=True/False` so failed mutations are queryable. The pre-existing `AuditLoggingMiddleware` row still fires too — that's the URL-pattern record; our new row carries the view-level detail.
- **2 new tests** in `vault.tests.PasswordMutationAuditTests` covering successful update + delete-with-title-preserved. Vault test count: 7 → 9.

## [3.17.180] - 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- **Silent exception swallowers in `core/` now log instead of disappearing** (Phase 7 polish — survey items #2 + #4):
  - `core/views.py` — the manual update-check endpoint had a double-catch around `AuditLog.objects.create()` to handle older DB schemas missing `extra_data`. The first catch is justified (legacy schema fallback), but the second `except Exception: pass` was hiding any real DB issue. Now logs via `logger.exception(...)` so a broken audit table is visible to ops.
  - `core/security_views.py` — `run_package_scan()`'s outer `except Exception:` returned a generic "Scan failed" 500 with no signal of the actual failure. `CalledProcessError`, `JSONDecodeError`, permission errors, OOM all looked identical. Now logs the real exception via `logger.exception('Manual package scan failed')` before returning the same response, so ops can triage.
  - `core/security_views.py` — the `try: subprocess.run(['sudo', '-n', 'apt-get', 'update']) except: pass` that wraps the optional pre-scan apt-cache refresh now narrows to `(TimeoutExpired, SubprocessError, FileNotFoundError)` and logs at INFO. Bare `except:` catches `KeyboardInterrupt` / `SystemExit` too — replaced.

### Changed
- **Two package-scanner API endpoints now use a decorator instead of inline staff-check** (Phase 7 polish — survey item #3). New `_staff_or_superuser_api` decorator at the top of `core/security_views.py` replaces the duplicated `if not (request.user.is_superuser or request.user.is_staff): return JsonResponse({'error': 'Permission denied'}, status=403)` block on `run_package_scan` and `update_packages`. Behavior identical (same 403 JSON response). The other 7 inline checks elsewhere in the file are deferred to a follow-up release — narrow scope keeps risk low.

## [3.17.179] - 2026-05-01

### Changed
- **Defender adapter clearly flagged as a reference stub.** The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security-alert provider in `security_alerts/adapters/defender.py` doesn't call the Graph API yet — it accepts a connection and returns an empty alert list. Previous label/messaging didn't make that obvious enough; an operator could pick it from the Connections dropdown and expect live alert flow. Now: (a) the dropdown label reads "Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (reference stub — no live alerts)", (b) the `test_connection` success message says explicitly "no live Graph API call is wired up. No alerts will be ingested until the adapter is fleshed out.", (c) the module docstring leads with "Not a working Graph API integration" and says explicitly not to enable it on a production tenant. Phase 7 polish-backlog item — closes the survey's #10 "TODO comments for deferred integration adapters".

## [3.17.178] - 2026-05-01

### Documentation
- **Roadmap Sizing-table row for Phase 10 brought up to date.** v3.17.176 + v3.17.177 already annotated the phase header, top-level bullets, and sub-phase blocks, but the Sizing table at the bottom still showed the original "2-3 weeks | extends existing IMAP poller" estimate with no progress note. Now reads "2-3 weeks — **10.1 + 10.2 shipped (v3.17.176 / v3.17.177); 10.3 + 10.4 in flight**". The JSON feed at `/core/roadmap.json` (which parses phase headers, not the table) was already correct — Phase 10 reports `status: in_progress`.

## [3.17.177] - 2026-05-01

### Added — Phase 10.2: Email body cleanup + attachment ingestion
- **New `psa/email_parsing.py` helper module.** Three pure functions, no DB / network / Django dependencies:
  - `sanitize_html(html)` — bleach-based, tight allowlist (block scripts, styles, iframes, objects, embeds, inline event handlers, remote images / tracking pixels). Surviving links get `rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"`. Output is safe to render inside a sandboxed iframe in Phase 10.4's conversation panel.
  - `strip_signature(text)` — RFC 3676 `\n-- \n` sentinel first; falls back to "Sent from my iPhone / Android / device" + "Get Outlook for iOS / Android" + "Sent via …" prefaces. Conservative: returns the input unchanged on no match.
  - `strip_quoted_reply(text)` — three independent passes (Apple/Gmail "On … wrote:", Outlook `-----Original Message-----` / From-Sent-To-Subject block, trailing `>`-prefix block). Earliest match wins; only ever trims from the bottom.
  - `clean_reply_body(text)` — convenience: quote first, then signature.
- **Poller (`psa_poll_email`) now uses the helpers.** Reply comments to existing tickets get the customer's signature + quoted history stripped so the comment shows only what's new (full body still preserved on `EmailMessage.body_text` for the conversation panel). New tickets keep the full body so context isn't lost. Inbound HTML bodies are sanitized at write time before landing on `EmailMessage.body_html`.
- **Attachment ingestion.** New `_ingest_attachments(msg, ticket=, comment=)` walks the message for parts with `Content-Disposition: attachment`, validates against MIME allowlist + size cap, and writes a `TicketAttachment` per accepted file. Rejected files are logged at WARNING level so ops can see what was dropped without crashing the poll loop. Filenames are stripped of path components defensively.
- **New settings:** `PSA_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` (default 25 MB) + `PSA_EMAIL_ATTACHMENT_MIME_ALLOWLIST` (images, PDF, plain/CSV/HTML/markdown text, Office formats including .docx/.xlsx/.pptx, ZIP). `image/*`-style wildcard entries are honored. Override via Django settings or env per deployment.
- **Tests:** 18 new tests across 7 classes — `HtmlSanitizeTests` (script/style/iframe/object/embed stripping, inline event handlers, remote images, link safety, empty input), `SignatureStripTests` (RFC 3676 sentinel, mobile prefaces, no-op, empty), `QuotedReplyStripTests` (Apple/Gmail, Outlook two forms, bare `>`-prefix, no-op), `AttachmentIngestTests` (allowlist hit, allowlist miss, oversize, `image/*` wildcard), `ReplyBodyCleanupTests` (full integration: customer reply with sig + quoted history → clean comment body, full body preserved on EmailMessage), `HtmlBodyStoredSanitizedTests` (poller integration), `MalformedMimeTests` (broken MIME doesn't crash the loop). 18/18 in <1s. Regression run on 10.1 threading suite + Phase4 + TicketLifecycle: 36/36 in 21s.

## [3.17.176] - 2026-05-01

### Added — Phase 10.1: Email-to-ticket threading via Message-ID
- **New `psa.EmailMessage` model.** Captures every inbound email's `Message-ID`, `In-Reply-To`, `References`, raw headers, plain-text body, and HTML body. Unique per `(organization, message_id)` so a Message-ID collision across tenants never threads incorrectly. Indexed on `(ticket, received_at)` and `(organization, in_reply_to)` for the lookup paths the poller and (future) outbound-reply helper use.
- **New `Ticket.last_inbound_message_id` cache field.** Stores the most recent inbound Message-ID per ticket so Phase 10.4's outbound replies can set their `In-Reply-To` header without a join. Updated by the poller on every match/create.
- **`psa_poll_email` now threads by header before falling back to subject regex.** Correlation order: (a) `In-Reply-To` against an existing `EmailMessage.message_id` in the same organization, (b) walk the `References` chain right-to-left and try the same org-scoped lookup, (c) the existing subject-regex fallback, (d) create a new ticket. The inbound `EmailMessage` row is persisted regardless so the next reply chains cleanly. Cross-org isolation is enforced by filtering the lookup by organization — same Message-ID across tenants never threads wrong.
- **Body extraction now captures plain-text and HTML separately.** The new `_extract_bodies()` helper returns both; the poller writes them to `EmailMessage.body_text` and `EmailMessage.body_html`. Phase 10.2 will replace the crude regex tag-strip with `bleach`-based sanitization. The pre-existing `_extract_text_body()` callable is preserved as a compatibility shim.
- **Tests:** 5 new test classes in `psa/tests.py` — `EmailThreadingByInReplyToTests`, `EmailThreadingByReferencesChainTests`, `EmailThreadingFallbackToSubjectTests`, `EmailThreadingCrossOrgIsolationTests`, `EmailThreadingNewTicketTests`. Mock IMAP via a tiny `_FakeIMAP` stub — no live network. 5/5 passing in 0.7s; targeted regression on the existing PSA test classes (Phase4 / TicketLifecycle / SLA / TimeTracking) 18/18 passing in 36s.
- **Migration:** schema-only (`psa/migrations/0027_email_message_threading.py`) — adds `psa_email_messages` table + `last_inbound_message_id` column. No data backfill: synthetic Message-IDs wouldn't appear in real customer replies, so the In-Reply-To path can't fire on legacy tickets via that route; the subject-regex fallback (still in place) handles them.

## [3.17.175] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Migration `0017_auto_apply_gunicorn_fix` no longer spams banner/error output during test runs and on fresh dev installs.** The migration runs `scripts/fix_gunicorn_env.sh`, which targets the production systemd unit at `/etc/systemd/system/clientst0r-gunicorn.service`; on any host where that unit doesn't exist (test runners, CI, containers, fresh dev installs) the script exited with code 1 and the migration logged "Fix script exited with code 1" on every test DB setup. Now skips silently when (a) `'test' in sys.argv` or (b) the systemd unit file isn't present. Production installs behave identically. Surfaces in cleaner test output.

## [3.17.174] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Bug fix in audit-log retention queries.** `core/settings_views.py` was running `AuditLog.objects.filter(timestamp__lt=datetime.now() - timedelta(days=days))` and `Session.objects.filter(expire_date__lt=datetime.now())` — the right-hand side was a *naive* datetime (server-local time) while the database columns are timezone-aware. With `USE_TZ=True`, Django emits a `RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField received a naive datetime ... while time zone support is active`, and the comparison silently treats the naive value as being in the configured `TIME_ZONE` rather than UTC. On non-UTC servers, audit-log cleanup and expired-session cleanup were applying a window shifted by the server's UTC offset. Now uses `timezone.now()` consistently.

### Changed
- **Sweep of deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` / lazy `datetime.now()` use across the codebase** (Phase 7 polish). Files updated: `core/settings_views.py` (8 sites), `core/security_scan.py` (5), `reports/generators.py` (8 incl. one `utcnow`), `core/management/commands/backup.py`, `core/management/commands/build_mobile_app.py`, `core/management/commands/restore.py`, plus dead `from datetime import datetime` imports pruned. All converted to `django.utils.timezone.now()`. Tests: 65/65 (`core.tests` + `reports`) passing.
- **Skipped intentionally:** `core/ai_abuse_control.py:_get_hours_until_reset` keeps `datetime.now()` because the AI rate-limit reset window is computed against server-local midnight (changing it would shift when daily limits roll over). `monitoring/models.py:155-163` keeps `datetime.now()` for its inline HTTP-response stopwatch (the proper primitive there is `time.monotonic()` — separate refactor). `integrations/providers/halo.py` token-expiry tracking is internal arithmetic, low priority. `scripts/network_scanner.py` is a standalone CLI script with no Django context; `datetime.now()` (which is *not* deprecated) is correct there.

## [3.17.173] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Bug fix in the bug-report endpoint:** `core/views.py` was using `datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC')` to stamp the timestamp on submitted bug reports. `datetime.now()` returns server-local time, but the format string lied and said "UTC" — the recorded timestamp was wrong by the server's UTC offset. Switched to `timezone.now()` (which is UTC when `USE_TZ=True`), so the "UTC" suffix is now accurate.

### Changed
- **Phase 7 polish:** removed deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` from the `/core/roadmap.json` endpoint and `datetime.now()` from the bug-report endpoint, replaced with `django.utils.timezone.now()`. `datetime.utcnow()` is deprecated in Python 3.12+ and will be removed in a future release. The roadmap-feed `generated_at` field now serializes with an explicit `+00:00` offset instead of a `Z` suffix; both are valid ISO 8601, downstream pollers should handle either.

## [3.17.172] - 2026-04-30

### Documentation
- **Roadmap: Phase 7 polish-backlog sub-bullet annotated for v3.17.171.** The tenant-isolation test-suite restore and the `/api/passwords/<id>/` audit-log crash fix are now reflected in `docs/ROADMAP.md`, so the rendered surfaces (in-app, About card, GitHub, JSON feed) all show the recent polish work.

## [3.17.171] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Audit logging on `/api/passwords/<id>/`, `/reveal/`, and `/otp/` no longer crashes.** The API password endpoints called `AuditLog.objects.create(... details=...)` but the model field is `description` — passing `details=` raised `TypeError` and 500'd every successful API password retrieve / reveal / OTP-generate. Latent bug since the initial commit (Jan 2026); never surfaced because no test exercised the success path. Found while rebuilding the tenant-isolation suite below.

### Tests
- **Rebuilt `core.tests.test_tenant_isolation`.** The file had rotted since v2.20.0 (Jan 2026) when `accounts.UserProfile.user` got `related_name='profile'` and org binding moved from `UserProfile.organization` to the `Membership` table. All 10 tests were erroring on `'User' object has no attribute 'userprofile'` — silently failing security regression coverage. Rewrite uses `Membership(user, organization, role=Role.OWNER, is_active=True)`, `force_login()` to bypass django-axes (which needs a real request), and `current_organization_id` on the test session to match the production `CurrentOrganizationMiddleware` flow. Also fixed: `Document.body` (not `content`), `/docs/<slug>/` (not `/docs/documents/<id>/`), `/vault/<id>/` (not `/vault/passwords/<id>/`). The "manager enforces isolation" test rewritten to exercise the real API (`OrganizationManager.for_organization()`) instead of a `set_current_organization()` helper that never existed. 10/10 passing in 30s; full battery (core + resourcing + processes + security_alerts) 45/45 in 86s.

## [3.17.170] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Phase 1 (Contract engine deepening) marked complete in the roadmap.** Header status now `[complete]` so the `/core/roadmap.json` polling feed reflects reality. Each of the seven sub-bullets is annotated with the version it shipped at: per-contract overage rules, role-based inclusion/exclusion, prepaid block hours with rollover, and proration → 1.1 (v3.17.126); auto-renewal, bundled services, and agreement profitability snapshot → 1.2 (v3.17.130). "Living plan" header note refreshed: Phases 1–6 + 9 + 31 complete; Phase 7 in progress (continuous track).

### Added — Future / late-stage roadmap entry
- **Phase 32 — Remote Network Discovery Import** added near the end of the roadmap as a future / late-stage feature (planned, not yet implemented). Spec covers: a new `network_discovery/` app with `NetworkDiscoveryToken` / `NetworkDiscoveryImport` / `NetworkDiscoveryAssetResult` models; five endpoints (generate, download, public token-only POST upload, revoke, import history); a downloadable PowerShell script that does a non-credentialed local sweep (ping + ARP + reverse DNS + optional 80/443/22/3389/445 probe); asset import with MAC-first then (org, location, IP) dedupe; security guarantees (single-use scoped tokens with 15-min default expiry, hashed-only token storage, write-only POST endpoint, full audit trail, rate limiting); UI section on the Org detail page; comprehensive test plan. **Explicitly not an RMM agent** — temporary, scoped, auditable, no persistent agents, no permanent credentials. Sizing-table row added.

## [3.17.169] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- **Phase 8 moved to last position in the roadmap** — Native mobile apps + GPS auto-time + Timeclock now appears after Phase 30. Phase 8 remains the largest single undertaking and depends on a lot of other work being mature first; positioning it last makes the priority order match reality. Sizing-table row also moved to the last row.

### Fixed
- **BillableTarget can no longer be self-edited.** Per user request, only managers/admins (users with the `resourcing_manage_cost_rates` permission) can set a tech's billable target — even the target user themselves can't edit their own. Old behavior allowed self-edit which mixed signals about whether a tech was meeting their target. Template now renders a "Your billable target is set by your manager." note when the viewing user lacks the permission. New tests in `resourcing.tests.BillableTargetPermissionTests`.
- **Workflow launch now asks which org instead of erroring** when invoked from Global view. Previously `/processes/<slug>/run/` returned "Organization context required." and redirected away. Now the form renders with an org picker; the user picks the org for that run; the rest of the flow proceeds normally. Same pattern applied to `process_create` (org picker on the new-process form). `process_edit` and `process_delete` fall back to the existing process's organization when invoked from Global view by a superuser/staff user. `process_list` / `process_detail` / `execution_list` get clearer redirect messages ("Switch to a specific organization first to …"). Locations + tag-views still use the legacy error message — pattern is established and can be migrated incrementally.

## [3.17.168] - 2026-04-30

### Added — Phase 9: Security alert ingestion (EDR / AV / Firewall)
- New `security_alerts/` Django app with three models:
  - `SecurityVendorConnection` — per-MSP-tenant + optionally per-client connection to an EDR / AV / firewall provider. 16 provider choices spanning CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender, Sophos Central, Huntress, ThreatLocker, Bitdefender, Webroot, Malwarebytes, ESET, Fortinet, Palo Alto, SonicWall, Meraki MX, Sophos XG, pfSense.
  - `SecurityAlert` — ingested alert with severity / status / asset_hint / raw_payload + audit fields. Unique per (connection, external_id) for dedupe.
  - `SecurityAlertRule` — auto-action rules with priority + match clauses (provider / category / severity-min / client) + optional suppression-window. Currently fires `create_ticket` action mapping severity → priority.
- **Provider adapter framework** (`security_alerts/adapters/`) — abstract `SecurityProvider` extends the v3.17.166 Integration SDK. One reference adapter (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) registered as a stub showing the integration shape.
- **Polling cron** — `poll_security_alerts` mgmt command runs every 5 min via cron, loops active connections, runs the matching adapter's `sync()`. Auto-installed in `deploy/update_instructions.sh`.
- **Webhook receiver** at `/security/webhook/<token>/` — CSRF-exempt, HMAC-verified inbound for vendors that push.
- **Triage pages**: `/security/alerts/` (list + filter chips + bulk ack/dismiss/convert), `/security/alerts/<id>/` (detail with raw payload), `/security/connections/` (CRUD), `/security/rules/` (CRUD).
- **Dashboard widgets**: 24h alerts breakdown by severity (table), open critical+high count (metric).
- **MTTA report** at `/reports/security/mtta/` — Mean Time To Acknowledge per client × vendor over a date window.
- 4 new RoleTemplate booleans: `security_alerts_view`, `security_alerts_manage_connections`, `security_alerts_acknowledge`, `security_alerts_create_rules`. Defaults wired across all 13 system templates.
- New top-level "Security" dropdown in the navbar.
- Tests in `security_alerts/tests.py` cover model dedupe, MTTA math, auto-ticket rule matching + suppression, webhook auth.

### Migrations
- `security_alerts.0001_initial`
- `accounts.0028_roletemplate_security_alerts_acknowledge_and_more` for the 4 new RoleTemplate booleans

## [3.17.167] - 2026-04-30

### Added — Roadmap status JSON feed for external pollers
- New endpoint **`GET /core/roadmap.json`** — parses `docs/ROADMAP.md` and emits a structured JSON feed of phase status. Lets external dashboards / status pages / customer portals refresh themselves without HTML scraping.
- Response shape: `{generated_at, current_version, phase_count, shipped_count, phases: [{number, title, size, status, version}, ...]}`. Status enum: `planned` / `in_progress` / `shipped` / `complete`.
- Verified parser: 31 phases extracted, 6 currently shipped/complete on the production checkout.

### Added — Roadmap entry: Configurable wallboards with widgets
- Added under Phase 3 (Financial Reporting + BI) as a planned extension of the existing v3.17.146 fixed wallboard. Multiple named wallboards per org, drag-to-reorder widget grid sourced from the existing dashboard widget registry, per-wallboard refresh interval, "rotate through wallboards" mode for NOC TVs.

### Changed — Roadmap-update rule expanded for the JSON feed
- `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and persistent assistant memory now require **phase-header status markers** in addition to the existing per-bullet version annotations.
- Each `## Phase N — Title ...` header should carry one of: `[planned]` / `[in progress]` / `[shipped — v3.17.NNN]` / `[complete]` (or the legacy `**— shipped**` / `**— complete**` inline form).
- When a phase completes, **always update the header marker** — otherwise the website's polling shows it as planned. Phase 7's header is now `[in progress]` reflecting the partial-shipped state from v3.17.166.

## [3.17.166] - 2026-04-30

### Added — Phase 7 (partial): Outsourcing workflow + Integration SDK skeleton
- **Subcontractor org type** — `Organization.is_outsourcing_partner` flag, auto-generated `partner_secret` HMAC key, `partner_endpoint_url` for inbound webhooks, `billing_markup_pct` for partner-time markup. New `subcontractor` choice on `ORGANIZATION_TYPE_CHOICES`.
- **`psa.TicketShare` model** — records tickets shared with partners (pending → accepted → completed; or declined / recalled). Unique per (ticket, partner).
- **Share endpoint** at `/psa/t/<n>/share/` — staff (with `outsourcing_share_tickets` perm) picks a partner; HMAC-signed POST fires to the partner's webhook with the ticket payload.
- **Inbound webhook** at `/psa/partners/webhook/<share_pk>/` — accepts comment / status updates from the partner. Validates HMAC signature; on comment creates a TicketComment with `source='partner'`; on status maps to local TicketStatus.
- **Outbound sync** — when a TicketComment lands on a ticket with active shares, fires the same HMAC-signed POST to each partner. Failures logged, not blocking. Same pattern for Ticket status changes.
- **Integration SDK skeleton** at `integrations/sdk/` — `IntegrationProvider` abstract base + slug registry + exception hierarchy. New providers register via `@register` decorator; resolved by slug or category. Foundation for Phase 9 security-alert vendors.
- New `outsourcing_share_tickets` RoleTemplate boolean. Defaults wired across all 13 system templates (Owner / Administrator / Full Admin / Tech Manager / Office Manager = True; Editor / Help Desk / IT Manager / Documentation Writer / Read-Only / Client / Client Admin / Technician = False).
- 6 new tests in `psa.tests` (TicketShareTests + IntegrationSDKTests).

### Phase 7 status
- Outsourcing workflow: shipped (this release).
- Integration SDK foundation: shipped (this release).
- Polish backlog: continuous.

### Migrations
- `core.0050_organization_billing_markup_pct_and_more` (Organization fields)
- `psa.0026_ticketshare` (TicketShare model)
- `accounts.0027_roletemplate_outsourcing_share_tickets` (RoleTemplate boolean)

## [3.17.165] - 2026-04-30

### Added — Phase 6.3 (closes Phase 6): Release management + Service-catalog governance
- New `psa.ReleaseWindow` model — auto-numbered `REL-YYYY-NNNNN`. Bundles N ChangeRequest records into a single deployment window. Statuses: planned -> frozen -> completed (or rolled_back / cancelled). Freeze flag locks further additions; rollback_plan + rolled_back_at + rolled_back_reason fields capture failed-deploy detail.
- New `psa.ServiceCatalogChange` model — proposal-and-approve workflow for service-catalog edits. When a `ServiceCatalogItem.requires_approval=True`, edits create a pending `ServiceCatalogChange` with `before_snapshot` + `after_snapshot` (JSON) instead of writing live. Approver applies the after_snapshot via `change.apply()`.
- `ServiceCatalogItem` gets `requires_approval`, `last_published_at`, `last_published_by` fields.
- 5 new RoleTemplate booleans: `release_view`, `release_manage`, `release_freeze`, `catalog_propose_change`, `catalog_approve_change`. Defaults set across all 13 system templates including the v3.17.164 MSP-named ones.
- Pages: `/psa/releases/` queue + detail + form. Endpoints: add-change, remove-change, freeze, complete, rollback.
- Pages: `/psa/catalog-changes/` queue + diff-view decide page.
- "Bundled into release" card on ChangeRequest detail when applicable.
- 5 new tests in `psa.tests` (ReleaseWindowTests + ServiceCatalogChangeTests + ReleasePermissionTests).

### Phase 6 status: complete.
- 6.1 Change requests + CAB (v3.17.158)
- 6.2 Problem records + RCA (v3.17.160)
- 6.3 Release management + service-catalog governance (v3.17.165)

### Migrations
`psa.0025_servicecatalogitem_last_published_at_and_more` (ReleaseWindow + ServiceCatalogChange + ServiceCatalogItem fields), `accounts.0026_roletemplate_catalog_approve_change_and_more` for the 5 RoleTemplate booleans.

## [3.17.164] - 2026-04-30

### Added — 6 MSP-named sample role templates
- Six new system role templates seeded by `RoleTemplate.get_or_create_system_templates`:
  - **Client** — customer portal user (files tickets, views shared KB / vault items only)
  - **Client Admin** — customer org admin (manages who at their org sees shared vault items + invites portal users)
  - **Technician** — internal staff doing day-to-day support work
  - **Tech Manager** — supervises techs (approves leave, dispatches, approves changes + PRs)
  - **Office Manager** — financial + operations (invoices, payments, aging, cost rates, CRM pipeline)
  - **Full Admin** — full access (alias for Owner)
- Built using a helper `_build(name, description, **overrides)` that defaults every RoleTemplate boolean to False and only flips the listed perms — keeps the diff small and means new RoleTemplate booleans added later default safely (False) for these sample roles.
- The existing 7 system templates (Owner / Administrator / Editor / Help Desk / IT Manager / Documentation Writer / Read-Only) are unchanged. Total: 13 system templates available out-of-the-box.
- Sample roles are user-editable via `/accounts/roles/` like any other role template — they're starting points, not locked-down system roles.

## [3.17.163] - 2026-04-30

### Added — Vault GeoIP / IP / Time access rules
- New `vault.VaultAccessRule` model — gates Password reveal + detail view based on the requester's GeoIP country, source IP / CIDR, and current time-of-day. Rules can be scoped to a specific Password, a specific User, or an Organization (three scopes per the user request).
- Decision engine in `vault/access_rules.py`: DENY-wins-then-priority semantics. Empty rule set → ALLOW (back-compat). Reuses the existing GeoIP infra from the firewall middleware.
- Admins manage rules at `/vault/access-rules/` — list, create, edit, delete. Each rule has: scope + target, effect (allow/deny), priority, GeoIP allow/block lists, IP CIDR allow/block lists, time-of-day window with timezone + allowed-weekdays.
- Every reveal attempt is **audit-logged** with the decision reason, source IP, country, and matched rule ID — even when allowed.
- Denied attempts render a clear "blocked by access rule" page with the reason, IP, and country.
- Password detail view shows a "N access rules apply" badge linking back to the filtered rule list.
- New `vault_manage_access_rules` RoleTemplate boolean (default False; Owner / Admin = True).
- 7 unit tests in `vault.tests.VaultAccessRuleEngineTests` cover no-rules / country-deny / deny-wins / time-window / CIDR / user-scope / item-scope.

### Migration
- `vault.0012_vaultaccessrule` (new VaultAccessRule model).
- `accounts.0025_roletemplate_vault_manage_access_rules` (new RoleTemplate boolean).

## [3.17.162] - 2026-04-30

### Added
- **Roadmap-update rule** codified: every release that adds, extends, or completes a feature MUST update `docs/ROADMAP.md` in the same commit. Documented in three durable places:
  - New `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root — auto-loaded by AI assistants working on the project; spells out the rule + release pattern + wording conventions.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` — new "Roadmap discipline" section under PR Process, plus a checklist item: "ROADMAP.md updated if the change touches a roadmap item".
  - Persistent assistant memory.

### Changed — Removed competitive framing from roadmap prose
- Roadmap title was "Roadmap to PSA-mature parity (ConnectWise / Autotask / Halo)" → now just "Client St0r — Roadmap". The project is described on its own merits.
- Phase 5 narrative: "ConnectWise's wedge: PSA covers sales-pipeline-to-invoice…" → "A mature PSA covers sales-pipeline-to-invoice…".
- Phase 24 RMM intro: dropped the explicit list of competing RMM products from the prose; the integration framework reference stays generic.
- Phase 29 migration scripts: rewrote "Migration scripts for ConnectWise, Autotask, Halo, IT Glue, Hudu" → "Migration scripts for inbound data imports from common existing platforms".
- About-page Platform Overview line: "PSA Integration: ConnectWise Manage, Autotask, and more" → "PSA Integrations: Multiple external PSA providers via the integrations framework (see Integrations table below)".
- The factual integration tables on the About page + README + FEATURES (which list real product capabilities like "we integrate with ConnectWise Manage / Autotask / HaloPSA") stay — those are not marketing positioning, they're feature statements.

## [3.17.161] - 2026-04-30

### Roadmap
- Added **7 new long-term phases** (24–30) to `docs/ROADMAP.md`, completing the user's requested feature list:
  - **24** Native RMM Agent + Endpoint Management (XL — patch mgmt + scripting + remote access; alternative to integrating external RMMs)
  - **25** Mature Timesheet Approval Workflows
  - **26** Custom Report Writer + Saved Queries
  - **27** Advanced Accounting Reconciliation (extends QBO/Xero)
  - **28** Browser Extension + Offline Vault Access
  - **29** Commercial Operations Ecosystem (continuous · meta — SLA tiers, onboarding, SOC 2 readiness, partner program)
  - **30** Endpoint Remote Access (smaller alternative to Phase 24)
- Sizing table updated; total roadmap now spans 30 phases. Items overlapping shipped phases continue to call out the deltas.

### Added — Roadmap published in About page
- `/core/about/` now has a prominent **Public Roadmap** card with summary of shipped / in-progress / planned phases + buttons to the live in-app roadmap, the GitHub source, and the full CHANGELOG.

### Fixed — Top navbar getting cut off at 100% browser font-size
With 7+ top-level dropdowns plus brand + search + clock + org pill + user dropdown, the navbar was overflowing on common laptop widths (1366–1600px). Tightened nav-link padding (0.4–0.55rem), shrunk nav-link font to 0.82–0.88rem, narrowed the search box, capped the org-pill width, hid the live clock at narrow desktop sizes, and added flex-wrap fallback so anything still over-running wraps cleanly instead of clipping. Mobile / tablet menus unchanged.

## [3.17.160] - 2026-04-30

### Added — Phase 6.2: Problem records + Root-Cause Analysis (ITIL)
- New `psa.Problem` model — auto-numbered `PRB-YYYY-NNNNN`. Links N tickets together to spot recurring incidents and isolate the underlying root cause. Status pipeline: investigating → known_error → resolved → closed (or duplicate). Priority: critical / high / medium / low.
- RCA fields: `symptoms`, `root_cause`, `workaround`, `permanent_fix`, `five_whys` (JSON list), and an optional FK to the `ChangeRequest` that deployed the fix.
- New `psa.ProblemNote` model — append-only investigation timeline with an `is_breakthrough` flag for key findings.
- Status-transition validation: can't reach `known_error` without `root_cause + workaround`; can't reach `resolved` without `permanent_fix`.
- Pages: `/psa/problems/` queue, `/psa/problems/<id>/` detail, `/psa/problems/new/` form. Endpoints: link-ticket, unlink-ticket, add-note, advance-status.
- Cross-link surfaced on ticket detail: a "Related problem records" card lists every Problem the ticket is linked to with status pill.
- 4 new RoleTemplate booleans: `problem_view` (default True), `problem_create` (default True), `problem_assign`, `problem_resolve` (default False — owner/admin gate).
- 7 new tests in `psa.tests`.

Phase 6 status: 6.1 + 6.2 shipped. 6.3 (release management + service-catalog governance) closes Phase 6.

### Migrations
`psa.0024_problem_problemnote_and_more` (Problem + ProblemNote), `accounts.0024_roletemplate_problem_assign_and_more` for the 4 RoleTemplate booleans.

## [3.17.159] - 2026-04-30

### Roadmap
- Added 14 new long-term roadmap entries (Phases 10–23) to `docs/ROADMAP.md`. None positioned as fully implemented; each labeled planned / in-progress / extends-existing-phase, with deltas vs. shipped work called out. AI-assisted features explicitly tagged **OPTIONAL AI** and tied to the existing `psa_ai_enabled` gate pattern.
- New phases:
  - **10** — Advanced Email-to-Ticket Engine (extends IMAP poller)
  - **11** — Advanced Dispatch & Technician Scheduling (extends Phase 2)
  - **12** — Customer Communication Workflows (extends customer portal)
  - **13** — Procurement & Lifecycle Management (extends Phase 4)
  - **14** — Visual Workflow Automation Engine (extends workflow rules)
  - **15** — Recurring Billing & Contract Management (extends Phase 1)
  - **16** — Documentation Relationship Mapping (new)
  - **17** — Advanced Asset Intelligence (extends RMM sync)
  - **18** — Multi-Location Client Hierarchy (new)
  - **19** — Advanced Reporting & Analytics (extends Phase 3)
  - **20** — Approval & Change Management Workflows (extends Phase 6.1)
  - **21** — Advanced Mobile Technician Workflows (requires Phase 8)
  - **22** — Knowledge Base & SOP Management (extends KB v3.17.128/134)
  - **23** — Security Event & Incident Workflows (requires Phase 9)
- Sizing table updated with the 14 new rows. Wording is operationally realistic — no hype/buzzwords; focus on MSP workflow consolidation and operational visibility.

## [3.17.158] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 6.1: Change requests with CAB approval workflow
- New `psa.ChangeRequest` model — one-to-one with a `Ticket` of type 'change'. Captures CAB-relevant metadata: risk (low/medium/high/emergency), implementation/rollback/impact plans, scheduled + actual windows, outcome summary, implementation_status pipeline (draft → pending_cab → approved/rejected → implementing → verified/failed/cancelled).
- New `psa.CABVote` model — one row per (change_request, user). Approvals require **every** `required_approvers` user to vote `approved` AND zero rejections. Falls back to the existing single-approval pattern when no required_approvers are set.
- Auto-create signal: any Ticket whose `ticket_type.slug='change'` spawns a draft ChangeRequest on save.
- New 'change' ticket type seeded by `psa_seed_defaults`.
- Pages: `/psa/changes/` (queue), `/psa/t/<n>/change/` (detail + vote form), `/psa/t/<n>/change/edit/` (form). Endpoints: submit / vote / implement / verify / fail.
- 4 new RoleTemplate booleans: `change_view`, `change_create`, `change_approve_cab`, `change_implement`. Defaults: Editor = view+create; Owner/Admin = all 4.
- "Change Management" card surfaced on the ticket detail page when ticket_type='change'.
- 8 new tests in `psa.tests`.

Phase 6 sub-phases left: 6.2 Problem records + RCA; 6.3 Release management + service-catalog governance.

### Migrations
`psa.0023_changerequest_cabvote_and_more`, `accounts.0023_roletemplate_change_approve_cab_and_more`.

## [3.17.157] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — Generated Reports list now actionable for legacy + failed rows
User reported they had no way to view or download reports at `/reports/generated/`. Root cause: rows generated before the v3.17.154 file-save fix have `status='completed'` but no `report.file` populated — and the templates only rendered View/Download buttons when `report.file` was truthy. So legacy completed-without-file rows had only a "View Details" link with no recovery path.

Fixed:
- **List page** Actions cell now shows a yellow **Re-generate** button when `report.file` is missing — POSTs to `reports:generate_report` with the original format. Works for legacy rows AND for previously-failed rows.
- **Status footnote** under Actions: shows the truncated error message inline for failed rows; shows "File missing — re-generate" for completed-but-fileless rows.
- **Detail page** mirrors the same logic: Re-generate button in the header when there's no file; alert banner inside the card explaining whether the file is missing (legacy) or the generation failed (with the full error message in a `<pre>`).
- Distinguished the "View Details" icon button (info) from the actual "View PDF" / "Download X" action buttons (primary / success) so users can tell at a glance which control downloads vs. which inspects metadata.

## [3.17.156] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Asset Summary Report failed with "Cannot resolve keyword 'name' into field. Join on 'asset_type' not permitted."** `Asset.asset_type` is a `CharField(choices=…)`, not an FK to `AssetType` — `reports.generators.AssetSummaryReport` was incorrectly doing `values('asset_type__name')`. Switched to `values('asset_type')` and translates the raw code to a display label via `Asset._meta.get_field('asset_type').flatchoices`. Output shape preserved (still emits `'asset_type__name'` key for downstream PDF templates), just sourced from the choices dict instead of a non-existent FK relation.

## [3.17.155] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 5.3 (closes Phase 5): Sales-activity timeline + lead capture
- New `crm.SalesActivity` model — polymorphic touchpoint log against a Lead, Opportunity, or client Organization. Activity types: call / email / meeting / demo / note / proposal_sent / contract_signed / inbound / other.
- **Activity timeline** card on Lead detail + Opportunity detail pages (last 15 entries) with "Log activity" button.
- **Web form lead capture** at `POST /crm/leads/capture/` — public, CSRF-exempt, honeypot anti-spam, IP rate-limited (10/min), creates `Lead` + auto `SalesActivity(activity_type='inbound', source='web_form')`. JSON response.
- **REST API lead capture** at `POST /crm/api/leads/capture/` — same shape, gated on existing API-key auth (`Authorization: Bearer itdocs_live_<key>`).
- **IMAP lead capture stub** at `crm/management/commands/poll_lead_inbox.py` — wired but full implementation deferred (Phase 5.4 follow-up).
- New "Recent sales activity" dashboard widget.
- 7 new tests in `crm.tests`.

### Phase 5 status: complete.
- 5.1 Lead/Opportunity/Campaign + pipeline Kanban (v3.17.152)
- 5.2 Commissions + lead scoring + sales funnel (v3.17.153)
- 5.3 Sales activity timeline + lead capture (v3.17.155)
- Roadmap updated.

### Migration
`crm.0003_salesactivity`.


## [3.17.154] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **"Issue #59" badge** on Settings → General removed (internal issue-tracker reference shouldn't be visible to end users). Comments in `accounts/views.py`, `core/settings_views.py`, `core/models.py` cleaned up the same way.
- **Generated reports view/download** — PDFs now open inline in a new tab (`target="_blank"`), other formats (CSV/XLSX) download as attachments. The `generated_download` view now decides based on `format`. Both list and detail pages show "View PDF" or "Download X" button as appropriate. PDFs that were previously force-attaching now render in the browser. Also: `generate_report` view now actually populates the `FileField` so the file is downloadable (was previously only marking status='completed' without writing a file).
- **`/inbox/` 404** — added a redirect view at `/inbox/` → `/psa/ai/inbox/` for legacy bookmarks. Found no stale templates pointing here.
- **Procurement permission gates verified** — confirmed `procurement_approve_pr` is required for `requisition_decide` (managers only) and `procurement_create_pr` is sufficient for `requisition_form` (any tech). `requisition_to_po` now accepts either `procurement_approve_pr` or `procurement_create_po`. Added inline help text on PR form: "Submit when ready — a manager will review before it becomes a PO." Requisition list now shows "My requisitions" view by default for non-approvers + a "Pending approval" filter shortcut for approvers. Submit button on PR detail is shown only to the requester (or admins) when status='draft'.

### Added
- **CRM feature toggle** — new `SystemSetting.crm_enabled` boolean (default False, mirroring `psa_enabled`). When off, the CRM navbar dropdown is hidden. Toggleable from Settings → General. Existing CRM URLs still work for direct access; the toggle only governs navigation visibility. Optional `@require_crm_enabled` decorator added to `crm/views.py` for views that want extra safety.

### Migration
`core.0049_systemsetting_crm_enabled` adds `crm_enabled` to SystemSetting.


## [3.17.153] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 5.2: Commission engine + Lead scoring + Sales funnel report
- New `crm.CommissionRule` model — per-tenant rule with `priority` ordering, optional user/value match clauses, `rate_pct` + `flat_amount` payout. Highest-priority active rule wins.
- New `crm.Commission` model — pending → approved → paid pipeline. Auto-created when an Opportunity transitions to `closed_won` via the new `compute_commission_for_opportunity()` engine. Idempotent: re-runs update, never duplicate.
- New `Lead.score` field (0-100) auto-computed in `Lead.save()` via a heuristic scorer in `crm/services.py` — bumps for estimated_value, target industries, employee count, contact data completeness, website, campaign attribution, ownership.
- New report `/reports/crm/sales-funnel/` — visual funnel from Leads → Qualified → Opportunities → Proposal → Closed Won with stage-to-stage conversion %. Date-range selector. Permission: `crm_view_forecast`.
- New CRM pages: `/crm/commissions/` + `/crm/commission-rules/`. Decide endpoint approves / cancels / marks paid with payroll reference + audit log.
- Tests in `crm.tests` cover rule matching, computation, engine idempotence, scoring, funnel.

Phase 5 sub-phase left: 5.3 Sales-activity timeline + lead capture endpoints (web form / IMAP / API).

### Migrations
`crm.0002_lead_score_commissionrule_commission_and_more` (CommissionRule, Commission, Lead.score).

## [3.17.152] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 5.1: CRM foundation (Lead / Opportunity / Campaign + pipeline Kanban)
- New `crm` Django app with three models: `Lead` (pre-qualification), `Opportunity` (deal in flight against an Organization, 6 pipeline stages), `Campaign` (marketing/outreach with channel + budget).
- **Pipeline Kanban** at `/crm/pipeline/` — 6-column drag-and-drop board (Discovery → Qualified → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won / Closed Lost). Each card shows opp name, client, weighted value, owner. Per-column totals at the bottom.
- **Lead → Org + Opportunity conversion** at `POST /crm/leads/<pk>/convert/` — creates a `core.Organization` and a draft `Opportunity` with the lead's data, marks lead `status='converted'` and links via `converted_to_*` FKs.
- **Opportunity → Quote conversion** at `POST /crm/opportunities/<pk>/to-quote/` — drafts a `psa.Quote` with the client_org pre-filled.
- 5 new RoleTemplate booleans: `crm_view`, `crm_create_lead`, `crm_manage_pipeline`, `crm_manage_campaigns`, `crm_view_forecast`. Defaults: Editor = view + create_lead + manage_pipeline; Read-only = view only; Owner / Admin = all.
- New top-level CRM dropdown in the navbar.
- Tests in `crm.tests` cover model props, conversion, kanban auth.

Phase 5 sub-phases left: 5.2 Commission rules + lead scoring + funnel reporting; 5.3 Sales-activity timeline + lead capture (web form / IMAP / API).

### Migrations
`crm.0001_initial` + `accounts.0022_roletemplate_crm_create_lead_and_more` for the 5 new RoleTemplate booleans.

## [3.17.151] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 4.4: One-click PO from accepted quote (closes Phase 4)
- "Convert to PO" button on accepted quote detail pages — POSTs to `/psa/quotes/<pk>/to-po/`, creates a draft `PurchaseOrder` with the quote's line items copied, lands the user on the PO edit page to pick a vendor + adjust shipping.
- New `PurchaseOrder.source_quote` FK — clean reverse link from quote → POs and forward link from PO header → quote.
- Optional vendor pre-fill via `?vendor=<id>` querystring (or POSTed `vendor_id`); auto-fills `vendor_name`, `vendor_email`, `vendor_phone`, `vendor_address`, and `expected_delivery_date` from vendor's `default_lead_time_days`.
- Permission: `procurement_create_po` (owners + admins by default; techs can't).
- 3 new tests in `psa.tests.QuoteToPOTests`.

### Phase 4 status: complete.
- 4.1 PR + PO + branded PDF + email (v3.17.148)
- 4.2 Receiving + back-orders + serial capture (v3.17.149)
- 4.3 Vendor metadata + stock minimums + auto-replenish (v3.17.150)
- 4.4 Quote-to-PO (v3.17.151)
- Phase 4 closed in `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

### Migration
`psa.0022_purchaseorder_source_quote` adds `source_quote` FK to PurchaseOrder.

## [3.17.150] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 4.3: Vendor relationship + stock minimums + auto-replenish
- Extended `assets.Vendor` with procurement metadata: `default_lead_time_days` (default 7), `payment_terms` (Net 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / COD / Prepaid / CC), `preferred_contact_method` (email / phone / portal), `contact_email/phone`, `billing_address`, `account_number`, `notes`, `distributor_provider` (ingram / pax8 / synnex link). Reused the existing global `assets.Vendor` model rather than introducing a separate procurement-only one — keeps the manufacturer-facing vendor catalog and the buy-from-vendor catalog in one place.
- `PurchaseOrder.vendor` FK alongside the existing `vendor_name` snapshot text. Picking a vendor on the PO form auto-fills `vendor_name`, `vendor_email`, `vendor_phone`, `vendor_address`, and `expected_delivery_date` (issue_date + `default_lead_time_days`) — both client-side (JS, fills blanks on change) and server-side (idempotent fallback when the form fields are blank).
- Vendor CRUD pages at `/psa/vendors/` (list / create / detail / edit) under the Procurement nav. Detail page shows: header card with metadata, Open POs (status not in cancelled/void/received), Recent closed POs (last 10), 90-day spend total, and an Edit button. List view shows payment terms, lead time, open POs count, and 30-day spend.
- Inventory items get optional `preferred_vendor` FK + `last_replenished_at` (existing `min_quantity` and `reorder_quantity` already cover stock minimums). Added to `inventory.InventoryItem`, `vehicles.VehicleInventoryItem`, and `vehicles.ShopInventoryItem`.
- New management command `psa_auto_replenish_suggestions` scans all three inventory surfaces for rows where `quantity <= min_quantity`. `--dry-run` lists them; `--create-prs` builds draft `PurchaseRequisition` rows grouped by `preferred_vendor` (one PR per vendor), skipping items whose SKU is already on an open PR. Quantity to order = `reorder_quantity` if set, else `2*min - current`.
- Daily cron at 06:00 logs scan results (PR creation is opt-in via `--create-prs` — admins decide whether to convert).
- New "Low stock items" dashboard widget surfaces top 10 items below minimum stock.
- Permissions: `procurement_view` to view vendors, `procurement_create_po` to create / edit.
- 6 new tests in `psa.tests` cover vendor metadata defaults / persistence / FK link, scan, PR grouping, dedupe.

Phase 4 sub-phase left: 4.4 — One-click PO from accepted quote.

### Migrations
`assets.0015_vendor_account_number_vendor_billing_address_and_more`, `inventory.0002_inventoryitem_last_replenished_at_and_more`, `psa.0021_purchaseorder_vendor`, `vehicles.0008_vendor_metadata`.

## [3.17.149] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 4.2: PO Receiving + back-orders + serial capture
- New `psa.POReceipt` model — one row per receiving event (carrier, tracking number, drop-ship confirmation flag).
- New `psa.POReceiptLine` model — per-line received quantity + JSON serial-numbers array.
- New `psa.POBackOrder` model — auto-created when a receipt is short. Auto-fills (status='filled') when the remaining quantity is finally received. Cancellable.
- Receive flow at `/psa/purchase-orders/<id>/receive/` — staff form with qty + serials per line + carrier + tracking. Receiving rolls up `PurchaseOrderLineItem.received_quantity` and recomputes PO status (sent → partial → received).
- Quantity capped at outstanding so over-receiving is impossible.
- Captured serial numbers auto-create `assets.Asset` rows (silently skipped if Asset model signature doesn't accept the inference).
- New `/psa/back-orders/` page — open back-orders across all POs with cancel action.
- "Receive Items" button on PO detail (when status is sent / acknowledged / partial).
- Receipts + back-orders cards on PO detail.
- 7 new tests in `psa.tests.POReceivingTests`.

### Migration
`psa.0020_pobackorder_poreceipt_poreceiptline`.

## [3.17.148] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 4.1: Procurement foundation (PR → PO + branded PDF + email)
- New `psa.PurchaseRequisition` (auto-numbered PR-YYYY-NNNNN) — internal request a tech files. Statuses: draft / submitted / approved / rejected / converted / cancelled. Optional `source_ticket` / `source_project` provenance.
- New `psa.PurchaseOrder` (auto-numbered PO-YYYY-NNNNN) — issued to a vendor. Statuses: draft / sent / acknowledged / partial / received / cancelled / void. Drop-ship flag with override ship-to.
- Both models have line items (`PurchaseRequisitionLineItem` / `PurchaseOrderLineItem`) with SKU + distributor hint (links to the existing Ingram/Pax8/Synnex catalog).
- PO branded PDF (mirrors Quote/Invoice ReportLab generator) + email-to-vendor sets `status=sent`, `sent_at=now`, audit-logged.
- Approval workflow: PR submit → approver approve/reject → PR-to-PO conversion endpoint copies line items.
- 5 new RoleTemplate booleans (Phase 3.6 pattern): `procurement_view` / `procurement_create_pr` / `procurement_approve_pr` / `procurement_create_po` / `procurement_send_po`. Editors can create PRs but not approve or send POs.
- 7 new tests covering numbering, totals, approval workflow, conversion.
- "Procurement" sub-section under the PSA navbar dropdown.

Phase 4 sub-phases left: 4.2 Receiving + serial capture + back-orders; 4.3 Vendor relationship model + stock minimums + auto-replenish; 4.4 One-click PO from accepted quote.

### Migrations
`psa.0019_purchaseorder_purchaseorderlineitem_and_more` for PR/PO models, `accounts.0021_roletemplate_procurement_approve_pr_and_more` for the 5 RoleTemplate booleans.

## [3.17.147] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 3.6 wave B: Scheduled reports runner + Client-health score (closes Phase 3)
- New management command `run_scheduled_reports` processes any `ScheduledReport` with `next_run <= now`. For each: generates the report (PDF/CSV via the existing `reports.generators`), saves a `GeneratedReport` audit row, emails it to recipients, advances `next_run` based on frequency. `--dry-run` and `--force-id N` flags supported. Failures don't advance the schedule (next tick retries).
- Auto-installed cron at `*/15 * * * *` via `deploy/update_instructions.sh`.
- New `client_health_score(client_org_id)` query — composite 0-100 score across 5 weighted components: SLA hits (30%), ticket velocity (20%), billing aging over 60 days (25%), engagement (15%), NPS proxy (10%). Categories: Healthy ≥80, At-risk 60-80, Trouble <60.
- New report at `/reports/psa/client-health/` — staff/financial perm. Sortable table with color-coded score badges, 3-up summary cards, component mini-bars per row, CSV export.
- Two new dashboard widgets: "At-risk clients" (table) + "Client health breakdown" (pie chart).
- 8 new tests in `reports.tests`.

### Phase 3 status: **complete**.
- 3.1 canonical query layer + Profitability by Client (v3.17.139)
- 3.2 TechCostRate + profit by tech/contract/project (v3.17.140)
- 3.3 effective hourly rate + revenue leakage (v3.17.141)
- 3.4 SLA trends + margin analytics (v3.17.143)
- 3.5 dashboards + 12 starter widgets (v3.17.142)
- 3.6 wallboard + executive scorecard + scheduled reports + client health (v3.17.146-147)
- Roadmap updated.

### Migration
`reports.0002_scheduledreport_output_format_and_more` — adds `output_format` field to `ScheduledReport` and makes `next_run` nullable.

## [3.17.146] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 3.6 wave A: Wallboard + Executive Scorecard
- **Wallboard** at `/reports/wallboard/` — TV-ready big-number live display. 6 mega-tiles (open tickets / SLA overdue / unassigned / P1 open / opened-today / closed-today), bottom marquee of 5 most recent tickets, on-shift techs row. Auto-refreshes every 30s via JSON poll to `/reports/wallboard/data/`. Pulsing red animation on the SLA-overdue tile if non-zero. Permission: `reports_view_dashboards`.
- **Executive Scorecard** at `/reports/exec-scorecard/` — single-page rolling 30-day MSP KPI summary. 8 hero cards (revenue with trend vs prior period, billable hours, realized rate, open tickets, SLA breach %, MTTR, active clients, tech utilization), 30d revenue + tickets dual-line chart, top 5 clients / top 5 techs / margin-by-service-line pie. Print-friendly. Permission: `reports_view_financial`.
- Both linked from Reports Home with conditional gating.

### Phase 3 status
- Sub-phases 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6A shipped. **Wave B** (scheduled reports + client-health score) closes Phase 3 next.

## [3.17.145] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Reports + sensitive-feature permission groups (RoleTemplate)
- 14 new RoleTemplate booleans across three groups:
  - **Reports & dashboards**: `reports_view_dashboards`, `reports_view_financial`, `reports_view_sla`, `reports_view_capacity`, `reports_manage_dashboards`, `reports_manage_scheduled`
  - **Resource management**: `resourcing_view_team`, `resourcing_manage_cost_rates`, `resourcing_approve_leave`, `resourcing_manage_holidays`
  - **Billing & financial**: `billing_view_invoices`, `billing_send_invoices`, `billing_record_payments`, `billing_view_aging`
- New `accounts.permission_utils.user_has_perm(user, perm_name)` helper + `@require_perm('...')` decorator. Mirrors the v3.17.134 KB pattern.
- Every report view now gated on a specific permission instead of the coarse `is_staff` flag. Defaults are tech-conservative: **Editor / Read-Only roles get dashboards only; financial / SLA / capacity reports default OFF**. Owners get everything; Admins get everything except `reports_manage_scheduled`.
- Role-template form (`/accounts/roles/<id>/edit/`) exposes all 14 new booleans across three new cards.
- Reports Home (`/reports/`) hides cards the user can't access — no more "click → 403".
- 12 new tests under `accounts.tests.ReportsPermissionTests` cover the gates (financial / capacity / roster / SLA + the helper itself).

### Backwards-compatibility note
- Existing staff users (`is_staff=True`) WITHOUT a `role_template` will fall back to the **Editor** profile — which means they LOSE direct access to financial / SLA / capacity reports. To restore access, assign them an Admin or Owner role-template, or a custom template with the relevant booleans set. Superusers (`is_superuser=True`) are unchanged — full access.

### Migration
`accounts.0020_roletemplate_billing_record_payments_and_more` — adds 14 new boolean fields.

## [3.17.144] - 2026-04-29

### Docs
- README "What's New" section refreshed for v3.17.121 → v3.17.143. Version badge bumped 3.17.120 → 3.17.143. Phases 2 + 3 added; AI Triage, admin assignment, KB perms, dashboards, integration status pills, KB categories tree all called out.
- FEATURES.md now documents the full Reporting + BI surface (canonical query layer, four profitability reports, effective hourly rate, revenue leakage, SLA trends, margin analytics, custom dashboards with 12 starter widgets), the Resource Management module (skills / certs / working hours / PTO / holidays / billable targets / tech cost rates / capacity report / skill ranking), and the AI Suggestions ticket button.

## [3.17.143] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 3.4: SLA trend report + Margin analytics by service line
- `reports.queries.sla_trend_by_priority(start, end, org, bucket)` — bucketed (day/week/month) SLA breach rates per priority. Returns chart-friendly parallel arrays.
- `reports.queries.sla_trend_by_client(start, end, org, top_n)` — top-N clients by ticket volume with their response + resolution breach %.
- `reports.queries.margin_analytics_by_service_line(start, end, org, dimension)` — revenue vs cost grouped by `ticket_type` / `closure_category` / `queue`.
- New report `/reports/psa/sla-trends/` — two stacked line charts (response + resolution breach %) + per-priority summary + top-clients side panel + CSV export.
- New report `/reports/psa/margin-analytics/` — tabbed by dimension; bar chart + sortable table with color-coded margin column.
- New dashboard widget: 'SLA breach trend 30d' (chart_line). Available in the widget data-source dropdown.
- 4 new tests in `reports.tests`.

Phase 3 sub-phases left: 3.6 (scheduled reports / wallboard / executive scorecard / client-health score).

## [3.17.142] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Custom Dashboards: actual widgets (closes empty-state placeholder)
- New `reports/widget_sources.py` registry — 12 starter widgets across metric / table / chart_bar / chart_line / chart_pie types: revenue this period, open ticket count, SLA-overdue count, unbilled-hours-at-risk, active techs, avg time-to-resolve, top clients by revenue, tickets by priority, my assigned tickets, revenue trend bar, tickets-opened line, billable-vs-nonbillable pie.
- Each widget calls into the canonical `reports/queries.py` so the same numbers appear consistently across reports + dashboards.
- `dashboard_detail.html` rewritten to render widgets server-side: metric cards with icon + subtitle, tables with `<thead class="table-light">`, Chart.js-rendered bar/line/pie charts. Bad widgets render an inline error chip — never crash the whole page.
- New widget CRUD: "Add widget" button → form with data-source select + title; per-widget edit + delete (gated to dashboard owner or staff).
- New management command `seed_default_dashboard` creates a "MSP Overview" global dashboard with all 12 starter widgets pre-installed. Wired into `deploy/update_instructions.sh` so installs land on a populated dashboard. Idempotent.
- Tests in `reports.tests` cover registry execution + CRUD POST.

## [3.17.141] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 3.3: Effective hourly rate + Revenue leakage reports
- New `effective_hourly_rate_by_client` and `effective_hourly_rate_by_tech` query functions in `reports/queries.py`. Per-tech version computes **realization %** (effective rate ÷ cost rate × 100, target ≥ 200%).
- New `/reports/psa/effective-hourly-rate/` page with tabbed By Client / By Tech views, summary cards (avg / highest / lowest / median), color-coded rate column. CSV export.
- New `revenue_leakage(start, end, org, stale_days)` query function — three categories: stale unbilled time, expired contract blocks, stuck draft invoices.
- New `/reports/psa/revenue-leakage/` page — single-screen view with $N grand total, three sub-tables, deep-link buttons to drill into each leak. Stale-days input. CSV export merges all three sections.
- Both reports staff/superuser only. Linked from Reports Home.
- Tests in `reports.tests` cover query math + view auth + CSV.

Phase 3 sub-phases left: 3.4 SLA trends + margin analytics; 3.5 dashboards / scheduled reports / wallboard / scorecard / client-health.

## [3.17.140] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 3.2: Per-tech cost rates + profitability by tech / contract / project
- New `resourcing.TechCostRate` model — effective-dated loaded rate ($/hr) per tech. Historical reports stay accurate after a raise / role change. `TechCostRate.rate_for(user, date)` returns the matching rate (falls back to the canonical `DEFAULT_LOADED_RATE = $60` from `reports.queries` if no rows configured).
- `cost_estimate_by_client` + `profitability_by_client` now use **per-tech rates** instead of the flat $60/hr placeholder. Existing report keeps working — it's strictly more accurate now.
- Three new profitability reports:
  - `/reports/psa/profitability-by-tech/` — hours / cost / attributed revenue / margin / utilization %
  - `/reports/psa/profitability-by-contract/` — per-contract margin
  - `/reports/psa/profitability-by-project/` — per-project margin
- Each has the same date-range picker (7d/30d/90d/YTD + custom), summary cards, color-coded margin column, CSV export.
- Cost-rate management UI at `/resourcing/cost-rates/` — staff list with current rate, per-user edit page showing rate history.
- Existing `/resourcing/me/` page now shows the user's current loaded rate.
- New tests in `reports.tests` and `resourcing.tests` cover effective-dated lookup, default fallback, and the three new reports.

Phase 3 sub-phases left: 3.3 Effective hourly rate + revenue leakage; 3.4 SLA trends + margin analytics; 3.5 Custom dashboards + scheduled reports + wallboard + exec scorecard + client-health score.

## [3.17.139] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 3.1: Canonical reporting query layer + Profitability by Client
- New `reports/queries.py` module — single source of truth for revenue / hours / cost / margin queries. Every Phase 3 report (and Phase 8 mobile timeclock utilization) will read from this module instead of building bespoke querysets per view.
- Canonical functions: `hours_minutes_by_client`, `hours_minutes_by_tech`, `revenue_by_client`, `cost_estimate_by_client`, `profitability_by_client`. All take `(start_date, end_date, organization=None)` and return list-of-dicts (no querysets) for clean JSON / CSV export.
- New report at `/reports/psa/profitability-by-client/` — date-range picker (7d / 30d / 90d / YTD chips + custom), summary card (Revenue / Cost / Margin / Margin %), sortable table per client, color-coded margin column. CSV export via `?format=csv`. Linked from Reports Home.
- Loaded-rate placeholder: `DEFAULT_LOADED_RATE = $60/hr` until Phase 3.2 ships per-tech cost rates.
- 6 new tests in `reports.tests` cover query shape, view auth gate, CSV export.

### Roadmap
- Phase 2 marked complete in roadmap. Phase 3 in flight.

## [3.17.138] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 2.3: Capacity report + skill ranking on dispatch board
- **Capacity report** at `/resourcing/capacity/` for staff/superusers — table showing per-tech target / scheduled / actual hours + utilization % over 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 / 12-week windows. Color-coded utilization (red <80%, amber 80-95%, green 95-110%, blue >110%). Grand total row.
- **Scheduled hours** = sum of `WorkingHours` × working days in window (subtracts `Holiday` + approved `LeaveRequest`).
- **Actual hours** = sum of `psa.TicketTimeEntry` durations within window.
- **Skill ranking on dispatch board** — new `rank_techs_for_ticket(ticket)` helper scores candidate techs by skill keyword match (+30 per hit), client-org membership (+20), on-shift status (+15), open-ticket load (-30 if 5+), on-leave today (-50). Top 5 surface as a per-ticket "Suggest" popover with one-click Assign.

Phase 2 complete. Next up per roadmap: Phase 3 (Financial reporting + BI keystone).

## [3.17.137] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 2.2: Holidays + Leave Requests + Billable Targets
- New `Holiday` model — org-scoped or global; `is_recurring_yearly` flag; `is_holiday(date, org)` classmethod.
- New `LeaveRequest` model — vacation / sick / personal / bereavement / jury / parental / unpaid / other; pending → approved/denied workflow with approver, decided_at, decision_note; half-day flag; `total_days` property; `is_user_on_leave(user, date)` helper.
- New `BillableTarget` model — per-tech weekly hours goal (default 32h/wk).
- `working_days_in_period(user, start, end, org)` helper subtracts WorkingHours gaps + holidays + approved leave. Used by Phase 3 capacity reporting and Phase 8.5 off-shift GPS suppression.
- Pages: `/resourcing/leave/` (my requests), `/resourcing/leave/approvals/` (staff queue with bulk approve/deny), `/resourcing/holidays/` (admin).
- Existing `/resourcing/me/` page now shows a Leave summary card + Billable target card.
- Audit-logged: every leave decision (approve/deny).
- Tests: 7 new in `resourcing.tests`.

### Migration
`resourcing.0002_billabletarget_holiday_leaverequest`.

Phase 2.3 — capacity report + skill-ranking on dispatch board — comes next.

## [3.17.136] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Public roadmap on website + GitHub + new Phase 9 (Security alerts)
- **Live roadmap page in-app at `/core/roadmap/`** — renders `docs/ROADMAP.md` server-side with markdown + tables + sane lists. Theme-aware styling, "View on GitHub" button. Linked from the user dropdown menu.
- **README "Roadmap" section** rewritten to point to `docs/ROADMAP.md` and list recently-shipped + in-flight + planned phases at a glance. Browsable on GitHub at the repo URL.
- **New Phase 9 — Security alert ingestion (EDR / AV / Firewall)** added to roadmap. Four sub-phases: connection framework, alert model + poller (5-min cron + HMAC webhook receiver), dashboard + auto-ticketing, reporting (MTTA, suppression rules, weekly digest). Provider types: CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender, Sophos Central, Huntress, ThreatLocker, Bitdefender, Webroot, Fortinet, Palo Alto, Sonicwall, Meraki MX, etc. Sizing M, ~5 weeks. Independent of all other phases.

## [3.17.135] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Service Catalog Tile / List view toggle
- Toggle at top of `/psa/catalog/` matches the org list (v3.17.115) and integrations (v3.17.133) pattern. Tile mode default. Preference persisted via `?view=` querystring + localStorage. List mode is a compact dark-mode-safe table (Name / Description / Default queue / Default priority / Fields / Status / Actions).

## [3.17.134] - 2026-04-29

### Added — KB: full CRUD + move + permission groups
- Inline **New article / Edit / Delete / Move** buttons on the PSA KB browse page (gated by new permissions). New article pre-selects the currently-filtered category.
- **Bulk move** — checkbox per article + "Move selected to →" dropdown. Single `POST /psa/kb/move/` endpoint validates permissions, updates rows in one query, writes one audit log entry per move.
- Inline **category Manage** button in the sidebar opens the existing `/docs/categories/?global=1` page.
- Five new **`RoleTemplate` boolean permissions**: `kb_view_articles`, `kb_edit_articles`, `kb_move_articles`, `kb_manage_categories`, `kb_publish_articles`. Defaults: Owner/Admin = all True; Editor = no manage_categories; Read-only = view only. Migration: `accounts.0019_roletemplate_kb_perms`.
- Permission groups (RoleTemplates) are listed + editable + assignable from `/accounts/roles/` — the existing page now exposes the new KB booleans.
- Server-side gate via `_check_kb_perm(user, perm_name)` helper — returns 403 if missing.
- New `KBPermissionsTests` + `KBMoveArticlesTests` in `psa/tests.py`.

### Changed — Integrations page condensed + Tile/List toggle + status indicator
- Condensed grid: 6-column tile layout on desktop, ~30% less vertical whitespace.
- New Grid ⇄ List view toggle (top right of page); preference persisted in localStorage + ?view= querystring.
- New status pill per integration: OFF / ON · Working (green) / ON · Broken (red, with error tooltip) / ON · Unknown (amber). Most visually prominent element on each row so admins can scan a 100-integration page in seconds.
- Search box filters by provider name + connection name.
- New `connection_status(conn)` helper in `integrations/status.py`.

## [3.17.132] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 2.1: Resource management foundation (skills, certifications, working hours)
- New `resourcing` Django app with three models: `UserSkill` (proficiency tiers + years experience), `UserCertification` (issuer + credential id + expiry warnings + attachment upload), `WorkingHours` (per-weekday windows; split shifts allowed).
- "My Resources" page at `/resourcing/me/` — three-card profile view where users manage their own skills, certs, and working hours.
- Staff-only **tech roster** at `/resourcing/roster/` — every internal user with skill counts, cert counts, "working now" indicator, expiring-cert warnings.
- Superusers + staff can edit anyone's rows via `?user=<id>` querystring; regular users limited to their own.
- New `UserProfile.is_working_now()` helper — used by capacity reporting (Phase 3) and GPS off-shift suppression (Phase 8.5). Backwards-compatible: returns True if user has zero WorkingHours rows.
- 6 unit tests in `resourcing/tests.py`.

Phase 2.2 (PTO + LeaveRequest + BillableTarget) and Phase 2.3 (capacity report + skill-ranking on dispatch board) come next.

### Migration
`resourcing.0001_initial`.

## [3.17.131] - 2026-04-29

### Roadmap
- Added **Phase 8 — Native mobile apps (iOS + Android) with GPS auto-time + Timeclock** to `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Reverses the earlier "PWA only" deferral. Five sub-phases: backend foundation (TechnicianLocation / TimeclockEntry / ClientSiteGeofence models + REST API), GPS auto-documentation engine, Timeclock feature (web + mobile, selectable per-tech and per-org), React Native build, privacy + safeguards (off-shift suppression, geofence-only mode, retention policy, audit trail).
- Marked Phase 1 sub-phases 1.1 + 1.2 as shipped in the sizing table.

## [3.17.130] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Phase 1.2 Contract engine: bundle editor + auto-renewal + profitability
- **Bundled services line-item editor** on the contract form — dynamic add/delete rows with live recompute (mirrors the quote/invoice pattern). Submitted as JSON; the view reconciles existing rows by pk and deletes removed ones.
- **Contract detail page** at `/psa/contracts/<id>/` shows: hours used / effective remaining, rollover state, auto-renewal indicator, bundled services table, **profitability snapshot card** (revenue / cost / margin / margin %), and SLA matrix preview.
- **Auto-renewal cron** — `psa_auto_renew_contracts` management command runs nightly. For each expired contract with `auto_renew=True`, creates a child contract with: same name/type, new period dates from `auto_renew_period_months`, fresh `hours_used_minutes=0`, applied rollover (unused × `rollover_percent`), copied bundle items, `parent_contract` linked. Old contract flips to `expired`. Idempotent — won't double-renew thanks to `renewals__isnull=True` filter.
- Cron auto-installed at 02:30 daily by `deploy/update_instructions.sh`.
- `--dry-run` flag for safe inspection.
- 4 unit tests cover renewal, rollover, dry-run, and auto_renew=False skip.

## [3.17.129] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — Admins can now actually assign tickets / tasks / projects / workflows / recurring schedules
- **Tickets**: the **Actions** dropdown on `/psa/tickets/<n>/` now shows an "Assign to tech" sub-menu for org admins, owners, staff, and superusers (anyone with `Membership.can_admin()` on the ticket's org). Each tech with an active membership in the ticket's org plus all staff/superusers appears as a one-click reassign target. New `set_assignee` action on `ticket_quick_action` enforces the same admin gate server-side and re-validates the target is eligible.
- **Ticket creation** (`/psa/new/`): admins now see an optional "Assign to" picker. Defaults to unassigned; ignored silently for non-admins so regular users can still file tickets.
- **Dispatch board** (`/psa/dispatch/`): the drag-and-drop endpoint (`POST /psa/dispatch/assign/`) was previously gated only by the generic `@require_write` decorator, which let any Editor reassign tickets. It now requires admin-level access on the **ticket's** org (not just the requester's currently-selected org) and re-validates that the dropped-on tech is staff or a member of that org. The board also now lists every eligible tech as a row, even if they have zero current tickets — so admins can drag a card to a brand-new tech.
- **Project owner**: `/psa/projects/<pk>/edit/` adds an "Owner" picker for admins. Members of the project's client org plus staff/superusers are eligible.
- **Project tasks**: the inline add-task form on the project detail page exposes an "Assignee" dropdown for admins, and each existing task gets a per-row reassign select. `project_task_add` and `project_task_update` now persist the picked assignee with the same admin gate and eligibility validation.
- **Recurring ticket schedules** (`/psa/recurring/`): the schedule form now has a "Default assignee" picker for admins. The cron runner already used `sched.assigned_to` to set each generated ticket's owner — until now there was no way to set it from the UI.
- **Workflow executions** (`/processes/<slug>/launch/`): the launch form now offers an admin-only "Assign to" picker so an admin can spin up a workflow on behalf of another tech. Defaults to the launcher.

### Helpers
- New `_can_assign(request, org)` and `_eligible_assignees(org)` helpers in `psa/views.py`. `_can_assign` returns true for superusers, Django staff, `Membership.role in ('admin', 'owner')`, and granular RBAC `org_manage_members`. `_eligible_assignees` returns all active org members plus all staff/superusers, ordered by username.

### Audit
- New `AdminCanAssignTests` smoke tests (`psa/tests.py`) — admin in org A can assign a ticket to a non-admin tech in org A; admin in org A cannot inject a tech who isn't a member of org A (unless that tech is staff/superuser); regular Editor in org A is forbidden from reassigning.

### No new schema

## [3.17.128] - 2026-04-29

### Added — KB categories + sub-categories on the PSA browse page
- The `/psa/kb/` page now has a left-sidebar **category tree** with unlimited hierarchy. Click a parent to see its articles + every descendant's articles; click a leaf to scope to just that category.
- Article rows show their category as a clickable badge — one click jumps to that category's filtered view.
- Category breadcrumb at the top reflects the selected path (Networking → Wireless).
- Search now respects the selected category — searches within the filtered subset.
- Empty-tree state links straight to "Manage categories" for superusers.
- **Superusers can now manage GLOBAL categories** from `/docs/categories/?global=1` — previously only org-scoped categories were editable. New "Switch to global / org-scoped" toggle on the category list page.

### No new schema
The data model already supported this (`DocumentCategory.parent` self-FK, `Document.category` FK) — this release is pure UI.

## [3.17.127] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Auto-notify techs on ticket assignment / schedule
- New per-user preferences in **Profile**: email me / text me when a ticket is assigned to me; email me / text me when an assigned ticket gets a due date.
- Email defaults ON, SMS defaults OFF. SMS requires a phone number on the profile + SMS configured globally.
- Reuses existing SMS plumbing (Twilio/Plivo/Vonage/Telnyx/AWS SNS) and Django SMTP.
- Dispatch board cards show small envelope / mobile icons next to each assignee — at-a-glance "will this tech actually hear about the assignment?"
- Trigger hooks live in `psa/signals.py`: `pre_save` captures prior `assigned_to_id` + `resolution_due_at`, `post_save` fires `notify_tech_assigned` on change and `notify_tech_scheduled` on due-date change.
- Notification failures are caught + logged; they never block ticket save.

### Migration
`accounts.0018_userprofile_notify_assigned_email_and_more` — adds 4 boolean prefs to UserProfile.

## [3.17.126] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Contract engine deepening (Phase 1, part 1 of 2)
- New Contract fields: `rollover_percent`, `rollover_expiry_days`, `rolled_over_minutes`, `rollover_expires_at`, `auto_renew`, `auto_renew_period_months`, `proration_enabled`, `billable_role_codes`, `excluded_role_codes`, `parent_contract` (FK self for renewal chains).
- New `ContractBundleItem` model — line items per agreement (e.g. "Managed AV per seat") with `quantity`, `unit_price`, `recurring_period`. Dynamic editor coming in v3.17.127.
- Helper methods on Contract: `effective_total_minutes()`, `effective_hours_remaining()`, `is_role_billable(code)`, `bundled_subtotal()`, `profitability_snapshot()` (revenue/cost/margin — coarse; per-tech cost rates land in Phase 3).
- "Advanced contract options" collapsible section on the contract form with all the new gauges + checkboxes + role-code lists.
- "Renew" column on the contract list shows an auto-renew icon for at-a-glance scanning.
- 7 new unit tests in `psa.tests.ContractEnginePhase1Tests` cover role gating, rollover with + without expiry, bundled subtotal, profitability snapshot keys.

### Migration
`psa.0018_contract_auto_renew_and_more`.

## [3.17.125] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **AI triage suggestions on PSA tickets** — every PSA ticket detail page now has an *AI Suggestions* button next to the existing *Suggest reply* / *Suggest actions* buttons. Clicking it asks Claude (Haiku, low temperature) for read-only triage guidance: likely causes, investigation steps, suggested actions to consider (the AI does NOT execute anything), questions to ask the customer, risk flags, and references to check.
- **Full guardrail reuse** — triage runs through the same context-builder (vault data is excluded), subject-keyword blocklist, output content filter, prompt-injection envelope, and per-org/per-user daily token quota as replies and actions. Triage adds two extra rate limits: 10 triage requests per user per hour and 50 per organization per day. Cross-tenant requests are rejected at the service layer.
- **Prominent advisory warnings** — every rendered triage suggestion shows an amber alert banner reminding techs that the output is advisory, must be verified against vendor docs and the customer's actual environment, and that the model can hallucinate or miss context. Each suggestion has *Mark helpful* / *Not useful* feedback buttons (write to `AIActionLog` for prompt-tuning) plus a *Generate fresh* button. Older triage suggestions on the same ticket collapse into `<details>` blocks.
- **New role-template flag** `psa_ai_request_triage` (defaults to True for any tech) — gated at the service layer; read-only members can request triage without elevating to write access.
- **New `kind='triage'` choice** on `AISuggestion` (model migration `psa_ai/0002_alter_aisuggestion_kind.py`); new system prompt at `psa_ai/prompts/system_triage.md`; new service `psa_ai/services/triage_generator.py`; new view `generate_triage` plus `triage_feedback` for the helpful/reject verdict; new URL `path('triage/<ticket_number>/', …)`; accounts migration `0017_roletemplate_psa_ai_request_triage.py` adds the role-template flag.

## [3.17.124] - 2026-04-29

### Docs
- README "Native PSA / Service Desk" caption was a 200-word run-on prose paragraph — converted to four scannable bullet groups (Ticketing & service desk / Projects, contracts & schedules / Quoting, billing & accounting / Automation & integrations) plus added the workflow-on-tickets feature.

## [3.17.123] - 2026-04-29

### Docs / repo
- **Refreshed screenshots** in `docs/screenshots/` for the v3.17.113 → v3.17.122 feature surface: dashboard Quick Actions tile row, PSA tickets list / new-ticket form (with workflow picker) / ticket detail / aging / recurring / workflow rules / dispatch / quotes / invoices / contracts / client account, organizations list-view + grid-view toggle, processes (workflow templates) page, and the new condensed "What's New" on `/core/settings/updates/`.
- **New screenshot generator** at `scripts/generate_screenshots_v2.py` — authenticates by injecting a Django session cookie (no login form, 2FA-safe), drives Chromium via Selenium, full-page captures up to 4000px tall, keeps going on per-page failures.
- **Removed stale top-level docs** that were one-off generated reports superseded by `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` / `FEATURES.md`: `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFIED.md`, `FEATURES_UPDATE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`, `README_ADDITIONS.md`, `README_CONTRIBUTORS.md`, `ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `SECURITY_SCAN_REPORT.md`, `QUICK_START_AUTO_UPDATE.md`, `MOBILE_APP_DEVELOPMENT.md`.
- **Updated GitHub About** — new description ("Open-source self-hosted MSP platform — IT documentation + native PSA / service desk + workflow engine. …") and added topics: `psa`, `service-desk`, `ticketing`, `workflow-engine`.

## [3.17.122] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **"Attach a workflow" picker on the New Ticket form was empty** in Global view. The v3.17.120 filter only showed workflows scoped to the current org *or* global ones — but most installs have all their workflows tied to a specific org (no globals), so the picker showed "— No workflow —" with nothing else. Now lists all published, non-archived workflows regardless of current scope, with each option showing the owning client name (or "global") for clarity.

## [3.17.121] - 2026-04-29

### Docs
- README + FEATURES refreshed for v3.17.113 → v3.17.120: badge bumped, "What's New" rewritten as scannable bullet groups (UI / dashboards, PSA workflow integration, other), expanded the *Process Workflows Embedded in PSA Tickets* section to cover all three attach paths + inline checklist + AJAX sign-off + audit history, added a *Workflow Templates Page* section.

### Known follow-up
- Screenshots in `docs/screenshots/` are stale — they don't show Quick Actions tiles, the inline workflow checklist on tickets, the sign-off history timeline, or the org list-view toggle. They need to be re-shot manually after applying this release.

## [3.17.120] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Attach a workflow at ticket creation
- The **New Ticket** form (`/psa/new/`) now has an "Attach a workflow" picker (above the Submit button). Pick any global or client-scoped workflow template to spawn the matching `ProcessExecution` immediately on save — the ticket detail page opens with the embedded checklist + sign-off history already in place.
- Optional. Existing flows still work: leave it on "— No workflow —" to create a plain ticket and use the **Launch workflow** button on the ticket page later.
- Picker shows only **published, non-archived** templates. When the form has a pre-selected client, the picker is filtered to that client's templates plus global ones; otherwise only global templates show.

## [3.17.119] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- Dashboard Quick Action tile **"Run Workflow"** now points to `/processes/` (the workflow templates page, where you click Run on a template and it spawns a ticket) instead of the legacy `/processes/executions/` list. This matches the v3.17.117 redesign where executions live inside tickets, not as a separate top-level list. The same page is reachable from **Operations → Workflows** in the top menu.

## [3.17.118] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Inline workflow sign-off history on tickets
- The PSA ticket detail page now shows a **Sign-off history** timeline below each workflow checklist — a chronological list of every audit-log event for that workflow execution (stage completed / uncompleted / created / completed / cancelled / failed) with the username, stage title, and time-ago.
- Each event has a coloured icon (green check for completion, amber undo for uncompletion, blue play for launch, etc.) so techs can scan who signed off on what at a glance.
- The full audit log is still one click away via "View full audit log →" — same `processes:execution_audit_log` URL as before.
- "Launch workflow" button on the ticket page is unchanged — attaches an existing workflow template to this specific ticket exactly like before.

## [3.17.117] - 2026-04-29

### Changed — Workflows now live inside PSA tickets
- Running a workflow on the **Workflows page** (`/processes/`) now always creates a **new PSA ticket** with the workflow's checklist embedded. The execution form has a "Client" picker; the new ticket is named `Workflow: <Process title>` and assigned to the chosen client.
- The **PSA ticket detail page** now shows the **full stage checklist inline** with AJAX checkboxes — no more bouncing to a separate execution-detail page to mark a stage complete. Progress bar updates in place.
- Visiting `/processes/execution/<pk>/` now **redirects to the ticket** if the execution is linked to one. Superusers can still see the legacy page via `?legacy=1`.
- Non-superusers no longer see the "View All Executions" link from the Workflows page.
- Added an info banner on the Workflows page: *"Run a workflow to attach it to a new PSA ticket."*

### Fixed — Six PSA forms no longer redirect with "Pick a client first"
The Project / Recurring Schedule / Contract / Email Config / Quote / Invoice **edit and create** pages now work in **Global view**. Each form has a Client picker; on save the chosen client becomes the form's tenant. No more bounce-to-list with an error message.

- Edit flow now loads the row by pk only (was previously gated by current-org filter), then derives the org from the row itself.
- Validation errors re-render the form preserving user input — never redirect.
- Each of the 6 templates got a new `client_org_id` selector at the top (above existing fields). The pre-existing `client_org` "linked customer" picker on quote/invoice/contract/project/recurring forms is unchanged — those serve a different purpose.

## [3.17.116] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- Quick Actions wizard now also shows on the **Global Dashboard** (superuser landing page). Was only on per-org dashboard before.
- Quick Actions extracted to `templates/core/_quick_actions.html` partial — single source of truth.

### Changed
- **Phase-2 density**: base font 14.5px (was 16px), tighter dashboard stat cards (h3/h4/h5 inside `.card` shrunk), `.fa-2x` / `.fa-3x` icons sized down, `.row.g-2` gutter cut to 0.4rem. Pages now hit the ~30% smaller target.
- "What's New" changelog block on the System Updates page is **dark-mode-safe and condensed**: theme-aware colors (no more dark text on dark surface), tighter line-height, smaller code badges. Future entries written as bullet lists for at-a-glance scanning.

## [3.17.115] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Org Members no longer auto-polluted.** The `create_default_membership` post-save signal silently bound every new non-superuser to the first active org. It is now **opt-in via thread-local flag** (`accounts.models._enable_auto_membership`) and OFF by default. Org-admin Add Member flow creates Memberships explicitly.
- Existing stale Membership rows are *not* auto-cleaned — review `/admin/accounts/membership/` and remove any that shouldn't be there.

### Added
- **Grid ⇄ List toggle on the Organizations page** for installs with 1000s of clients.
- List mode: compact table — Name / Slug / Active members / Asset count / Status / Created / Actions.
- Pagination — 50 rows in list mode, 24 cards in grid mode.
- Search box filters name + slug; survives across pagination + toggle.
- Annotated counts (no N+1) via `Count('memberships', filter=Q(is_active=True), distinct=True)`.
- View choice persisted in `localStorage` + `?view=list` querystring.

## [3.17.114] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- **Quick Actions wizard** on the dashboard — large icon tiles for the 8 most-used create flows (New Ticket, Add Asset, New Password, Add Document, Scan Receipt, Run Workflow, New Quote, New Invoice).
- PSA + Vehicle tiles auto-hidden when `psa_enabled` / `vehicles_enabled` is off.

### Changed
- **~30% page-density reduction site-wide.** Single CSS layer in `custom.css` tightens cards, headings, tables, buttons, inputs, breadcrumbs, nav tabs, list groups.
- **Global KB link is now PSA-aware** — hidden when PSA is on (lives under PSA → KB), shown when PSA is off.

## [3.17.113] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed
- **Dark-mode contrast across all PSA + portal list pages.** Bootstrap's `.table-light` was hard-pinning a white header background even in dark themes, so 22 templates rendered white-on-white. One global CSS rule re-binds the Bootstrap table vars on `[data-bs-theme="dark"]` and fixes them all (Aging, Recurring, Tickets, Quotes, Invoices, Contracts, Approvals, Workflow Rules, Email configs, Canned replies, Catalog, KB browse, Projects, Vault context, Portal vault/KB/tickets).
- Generic `.bg-light` and `.bg-light.text-dark` badge combo also softened in dark mode.

### Removed
- Duplicate **"Global KB"** link from the primary navbar (lives under PSA → KB now).

## [3.17.112] - 2026-04-28

### Added — Per-org client portal branding
The portal navbar and login page now show the client organization's logo (`Organization.logo`) when one is set on the org row, instead of the default life-ring icon. Falls back to the icon + org name when no logo is configured. No new model fields — uses the existing `Organization.logo` ImageField.

### Added — Drag-and-drop on the dispatch board
The dispatch board (`/psa/dispatch/`) now supports HTML5 drag-and-drop reassignment. Drag a ticket card from one technician's column to another to reassign — the change persists to the database via a new `POST /psa/dispatch/assign/` endpoint with optimistic UI and a Bootstrap toast on success/error. Failed reassignments roll back the card and reload the page. Every drag generates an audit-log entry (`assigned_to` field change) just like a manual edit would.

### Added — Visual workflow rule builder
The "New / Edit Workflow Rule" form (`/psa/workflow-rules/new/`) is now a visual builder with click-to-add condition rows and action rows — pick a field from a dropdown, get a typed value picker (priority codes, queue names, status slugs, ticket-type slugs, boolean for is_unassigned/is_paused, free text for subject_contains). The legacy raw-JSON textareas are still present in an "Advanced raw JSON" collapsible block, and existing rules with combinators (`any` / `all` / `__in` / `__not`) auto-fall-back to raw-JSON mode so they remain editable without data loss.

### Added — Test coverage for v3.17.105–107 + v3.17.111
14 new unit tests in `psa/tests.py`:
- `WorkflowOnTicketTests` — `ProcessExecution.native_psa_ticket` FK + reverse-query (v3.17.105)
- `PortalUserInviteTests` — `Document.is_client_visible` default-false (v3.17.106)
- `PortalVaultRBACTests` — `Password.visible_to_portal_user` across all four `client_access_mode` values + the personal/anonymous edge cases (v3.17.107)
- `WorkflowRuleMSPWideTests` — `WorkflowRule(organization=None)` fires on every client's tickets (v3.17.111)

## [3.17.111] - 2026-04-29

### Changed — Workflow Rules are MSP-wide by default
- **`psa.WorkflowRule.organization`** is now **nullable** (was required). A NULL organization means "applies to every ticket regardless of client". Existing rules with an org are still respected — they scope to that client only.
- **No more "Pick a client first" redirect** when creating or editing a workflow rule. The form has an "Applies to" picker that defaults to "All clients (every ticket)".
- **Engine** (`psa.workflow_engine.fire`) now matches `Q(organization__isnull=True) | Q(organization=ticket.organization)` — both MSP-wide and tenant-scoped rules fire for the right tickets.
- **Rule list** shows an "Applies to" column with a green "All clients" badge for global rules, grey badge for client-scoped.

### Changed — Cron jobs auto-installed by the update script
The `deploy/update_instructions.sh` now registers three cron jobs in the running user's crontab if they aren't already present (idempotent — checked by string match):
- `*/15 * * * * psa_run_recurring_tickets` — preventive maintenance ticket creation
- `*/5 * * * * psa_poll_email` — email-to-ticket IMAP poller
- `0 * * * * sync_distributors` — distributor health probe (Ingram / Pax8 / Synnex)

The "Cron setup" instruction boxes on the Recurring Tickets and Email Ingestion pages were rewritten to a green "Cron auto-installed" indicator with a `crontab -l | grep ...` verification snippet.

### Migration
`psa.0017_alter_workflowrule_organization`.

## [3.17.110] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — Proper Advanced-setup CodeQL workflow
The Default-setup CodeQL has a cached language list that includes `java-kotlin` and `c-cpp` (set when those files existed in the repo, before v3.17.108 untracked them). Even with zero source files for those languages now, Default keeps trying to scan them and fails with "Extraction failed: No source files found." — see `CODE_SCANNING_IS_STEADY_STATE_DEFAULT_SETUP: true` in the run env.

Adding a properly-formatted Advanced-setup `codeql.yml` (this time `paths-ignore` is correctly nested inside the `config:` block, not a top-level input). After this lands and you switch to Advanced setup in the GitHub UI, only `python` / `javascript-typescript` / `actions` will run — all of which already pass.

**Manual one-click step needed:** Repo → **Security** tab → **Code scanning** → CodeQL row → kebab `⋮` → **Switch to advanced** (or **Disable** the Default setup). After that one click, Default stops running and the new workflow takes over.

## [3.17.109] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — CodeQL workflow file removed (was broken + now redundant)
The custom `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` added in v3.17.102 had `paths-ignore` as a top-level input, which is NOT valid on `github/codeql-action/init@v3` — the proper place is inside a `config:` block or a separate `codeql-config.yml` file. That broken syntax caused all three jobs (python / javascript-typescript / actions) to fail on the v3.17.108 push.

With `clientst0r-android/` untracked in v3.17.108, the custom workflow is also redundant: Default setup auto-detects only the languages still in the repo (python / javascript-typescript / actions) — exactly what we want. Removing the custom workflow lets Default setup handle CodeQL again. Same scan coverage, no failing jobs.

## [3.17.108] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed — CodeQL java-kotlin / c-cpp failures
Untracked `clientst0r-android/` (37 files of Kotlin source + Gradle wrapper). The Default-setup CodeQL was auto-detecting Kotlin from those files and trying to build them in CI without an Android SDK, which failed every push. With no Kotlin / Java / C / C++ files left in the repo, GitHub's auto-detect should fall back to scanning only Python, JS/TS, and Actions — all of which currently pass.

The Android source is preserved on disk locally; just no longer in this repo. Recommended next step: push it to a separate repo (e.g. `agit8or1/clientst0r-android`) so it can have its own CI with the Android SDK installed.

`.gitignore` now excludes `clientst0r-android/` so it doesn't get re-added accidentally.

## [3.17.107] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Vault items for the customer portal + per-org RBAC
- **`vault.Password.client_visible`** boolean — gates whether a credential ever appears in the portal at all (default off).
- **`vault.Password.client_access_mode`** with four modes:
  - `none` — staff only (default)
  - `all_org` — every active member of the client org sees it
  - `specific_users` — explicit list (M2M `client_allowed_users`)
  - `org_admin_managed` — delegates the per-user list to a portal user marked **org admin**
- **`vault.Password.client_allowed_users`** M2M to User — only honoured for `specific_users` and `org_admin_managed` modes; the staff form filters this picker to active members of the credential's org.
- **`Password.visible_to_portal_user(user)`** helper — single source of truth for visibility rules. Always denies if the user has no active Membership in this org.
- **`accounts.Membership.is_org_admin`** boolean — independent of the staff Admin role; lets a portal user manage which colleagues see `org_admin_managed` items in their own org.

### Customer portal additions
- **`/portal/vault/`** — list of credentials this user can see, with reveal modal. Reveals are audit-logged via `audit.AuditLog`.
- **`/portal/vault/<pk>/reveal/`** — POST-only JSON endpoint, defence-in-depth re-checks visibility before returning plaintext.
- **Org admin pages** at `/portal/vault/admin/` and `/portal/vault/admin/<pk>/` — per-item user-checkbox grid; org admins flip access for their colleagues. Self-grant cannot be removed by accident (checkbox is disabled-but-hidden-input on the row).
- **Credentials nav entry** on the portal layout, plus a "Manage access for my team" button on the vault list when `is_org_admin=True`.

### Staff additions
- **Vault password form** gets a "Client portal access" card (visible flag + access mode + allowed users picker scoped to org members).
- **Portal invite form** gets an `is_org_admin` checkbox so the inviting MSP admin can mark the recipient as the client's org admin in one step.

### Migrations
- `vault.0011_password_client_access_mode_and_more`
- `accounts.0016_membership_is_org_admin`

### Notes
- Audit-logging on every reveal: `view` action with `object_type=vault.Password`, plus the user's email in the description.
- `is_personal=True` (My Vault) passwords are unconditionally NOT portal-visible.
- A user must have an active Membership in the password's organization OR they get denied even if their User pk is in `client_allowed_users` (defence in depth — prevents stale grants).

## [3.17.106] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Client portal users + KB articles for clients
- **Invite portal user** flow at `/psa/clients/<id>/invite-portal/` — admin enters email + name, system creates a Django `User` (or reuses existing matching email), adds a read-only `Membership` in the client org, enables the portal for that org if it isn't already, generates a one-time tokenised set-password link via `default_token_generator`, and emails the invitee. Audit-logged.
- **`accounts:portal_set_password`** consumes the invite token at `/account/portal/set-password/<uidb64>/<token>/`. Requires the recipient to set a password ≥12 chars; on success signs them in and redirects to `/portal/`.
- **`docs.Document.is_client_visible`** boolean — staff toggle so a doc is shown in the customer portal KB.
- **`/portal/kb/`** — KB browser inside the portal. Lists documents with `is_client_visible=True AND is_published=True` AND (`is_global=True` OR scoped to the user's client org). Search box, deep-link to article detail. New nav entry on the portal layout.
- **`/portal/kb/<slug>/`** — read-only article detail. Markdown content rendered as line-broken text, HTML content rendered as `safe` (trusted staff-published content).
- **Invite portal user button** on the Client Account page next to "Client profile".

### Notes on the data model
There is **no separate "client user" table**. A client user is a regular `auth.User` with an active `accounts.Membership` in a client `core.Organization` whose `psa.ClientPSASettings.portal_enabled=True`. The `portal_required` decorator gates portal views on that combination. Staff users (superuser / `is_staff`) are NOT auto-granted portal access — the portal is for clients only.

Migrations: `docs.0013_document_is_client_visible`.

## [3.17.105] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Apply workflows (multi-step processes) to native PSA tickets
- **`processes.ProcessExecution.native_psa_ticket`** FK on the existing process-execution model. Previously executions could link only to third-party (`integrations.PSATicket`) tickets; now they can attach to native PSA tickets too.
- **Launch workflow button** on ticket detail. Opens a picker of active processes (organization-scoped + global) with optional notes, creates a `ProcessExecution` linked to the ticket, drops a system note on the ticket timeline, and redirects to the execution page so the tech can step through stages.
- **Workflows card** on ticket detail lists every execution launched against the ticket with status badges (in progress / completed / cancelled / failed) and deep-links to each execution.
- New URL: `psa:ticket_launch_workflow` at `/psa/t/<ticket_number>/workflow/launch/`.

Distinct from `psa.WorkflowRule` (the JSON-DSL automated rule engine that fires on ticket events). `ProcessExecution` is for multi-step procedural workflows that humans walk through (e.g., a 7-stage onboarding checklist defined in `processes.Process`).

Migration: `processes.0005_processexecution_native_psa_ticket_and_more`.

## [3.17.104] - 2026-04-28

### Docs — Re-captured PSA screenshots in clean light theme
The 28 v3.17.103 screenshots were captured under the admin user's dark theme + random background, which made them ~10× larger than the existing screenshots and visually inconsistent. Regenerated all 28 with admin temporarily set to `theme=default` and `background_mode=none`, then restored. Also dismissed the PWA install banner and set `global_view_mode=True` so the yellow "pick a client" bar isn't visible. File sizes dropped from 1–1.8 MB down to 70–250 KB (matching `dashboard.png`/`assets-list.png` scale). Layout now matches the rest of the README screenshot grid.

The `psa-kb.png` capture is still pending — its 500-page bug fix from v3.17.103 will deploy once you Apply that update; I'll re-shoot then.

## [3.17.103] - 2026-04-28

### Docs — 28 PSA screenshots captured
Added 28 new screenshots to `docs/screenshots/` covering the entire PSA module. Captures include tickets / ticket detail / new ticket / service catalog / projects / project detail / recurring / recurring form / approvals / contracts / contract SLA matrix editor / quotes / quote detail / quote form / **customer e-sign canvas** / **branded quote PDF** / invoices / invoice detail / invoice form / **branded invoice PDF** / **client account view (balance + aging + charges)** / aging report / dispatch board / workflow rules / workflow rule form / email-to-ticket / distributors / accounting (QBO + Xero) / organizations.

README's PSA section shows 15 inline images and the screenshot index lists every new capture with deep-link descriptions. Captures were taken via headless Chromium + Selenium with an injected Django session against the live dev server, using the seeded demo data (ACME Industries / Globex / Initech / Demo MSP).

### Fixed
- `templates/psa/kb_browse.html` was reversing a non-existent `docs:document_view` URL → 500 on `/psa/kb/`. Fixed to `docs:document_detail` (the actual URL name; uses slug not pk).

## [3.17.102] - 2026-04-28

### Docs
- **README.md** gets a Native PSA / Service Desk blurb in the screenshot grid and a new section listing every PSA page that's ready to screenshot (~39 PNGs).
- **FEATURES.md** updated through Phase 10: quote PDF + email + e-sign, invoices/payments + branded PDF + accounting push, client account + aging + charges, accounting integrations (QuickBooks Online + Xero with OAuth2).
- **docs/SCREENSHOT_CHECKLIST.md** rewritten for v3.17.x (was at v3.10.7). Lists 39 pending PSA screenshots organized by phase + 32 existing flagged for re-capture.

### Fixed
- **CodeQL workflow** — replaced GitHub's "Default setup" (which auto-detected Java/Kotlin and C/C++ but had nothing to build for either) with an explicit `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` scanning only `python`, `javascript-typescript`, and `actions`. The Android (`clientst0r-android/`) and `mobile-app/` paths are excluded since they need an Android SDK to compile in CI.
- **Heads up:** GitHub usually disables the Default-setup CodeQL automatically once an explicit workflow lands. If both still trigger, switch to "Advanced setup" in repo Settings → Code security.

## [3.17.101] - 2026-04-28

### Added — Phase 10: Client account, Charges, Aging report
- **Per-client account view** at `/psa/clients/<org_id>/account/` — net balance, outstanding invoices, available credits, uninvoiced charges, aging buckets (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+), invoice list, payment history, and unbilled time + expenses ready to invoice.
- **Charges** (`psa.Charge`) — direct line entries against a client account, independent of invoices. Supports one-time vs recurring (monthly/quarterly/yearly), credit flag (subtracts from balance), and roll-into-invoice for batched billing. Create one inline from the client account page.
- **"Invoice now" button** on the client account view — bundles all uninvoiced charges and credits for the client into a new draft invoice and marks each charge as invoiced. Credits come through as negative-amount line items.
- **Aging report** at `/psa/aging/` — cross-client outstanding balances bucketed by age past due date. Per-row deep link into each client's account view.
- **`Account` button** on the Clients (organization) list — quick jump from the org list to that client's PSA account view.
- **PSA dropdown gains an Aging Report entry**.

### API
- `psa.models.get_psa_balance(client_org, msp_org=None)` returns the same dict the views render: `outstanding`, `credit_total`, `uninvoiced_charges`, `net_balance`, plus an `aging` dict keyed by bucket name.

## [3.17.100] - 2026-04-28

### Changed — Dev workflow: assistant edits gated by Apply update
Going forward the AI assistant works in a separate worktree at `/home/administrator/.dev-worktree/` on the `dev-work` branch. Pushes go to `origin/main`, so `/home/administrator/` sees an **Update available** prompt and the user must click **Apply update** in the web UI (Settings → Updates) for changes to land. The assistant no longer edits the running source tree directly nor restarts gunicorn.

This commit is the first one made entirely through the new workflow — if you're seeing it as "Update available" in the dashboard rather than already applied, the gating is working.

## [3.17.99] - 2026-04-28

### Changed — Invoice form matches the compact quote form
- Same compact `form-control-sm` density, single-line description, dynamic add/delete line items, live-recompute subtotal/tax/total.

### Added — PDF / Download / Email buttons on the list rows
- Quote and Invoice list rows now have inline icon buttons: View, Edit, View PDF, Download PDF, Email. The detail-page buttons are still there too; the list rows just save a click for the common cases.

## [3.17.98] - 2026-04-28

### Added — Phase 9: PDF + Email for Quotes & Invoices
- **Branded PDF rendering** (`psa.pdf` — ReportLab) with shared layout for quotes and invoices: logo header (org logo with system custom_logo fallback), kicker block (number / date / due-or-valid-until), From/Bill-to address blocks, line-items table with alternating row banding, tax/subtotal/total summary, page footer with page numbers and brand mark.
- **View / Download PDF** buttons on quote and invoice detail pages — `?download=1` forces an attachment Content-Disposition.
- **Email modal** on quote and invoice detail — sends the PDF as an attachment to the customer. For quotes, the body includes the customer's e-sign link. Auto-flips quote/invoice to `sent` if it was `draft`. Audit-logged.
- **Quote detail page** (`/psa/quotes/<id>/`) — new, mirrors the invoice detail layout: stats card, line items, signature record (when signed), accept-with-create-ticket form, and the email/PDF/sign-URL buttons.

### Changed
- **Quote form qty + unit-price columns widened** (120px / 140px / 130px) so values aren't truncated.
- **Quote list** number column now links to the new quote detail page.
- **Invoice and quote detail layouts are now consistent** — same header structure, same button order, same email modal.

### Dependencies
- Added `reportlab>=4.0,<5.0` to requirements.txt.

## [3.17.97] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- **Saving a quote or invoice crashed** with `TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'decimal.Decimal'`. The view assigns `tax_rate` from POST as a string; `Decimal × str` was reversing into `str.__rmul__(Decimal)`. Both `Quote.recompute_totals()`, `Invoice.recompute_totals()`, and the line-item `line_total` properties now coerce all numeric inputs to `Decimal` defensively before arithmetic.

### Changed
- **Quote form is much smaller** — compact `form-control-sm` inputs, smaller labels, single-line description, footer subtotal/tax/total that updates live as you edit. Old form was visually heavy.
- **Add / remove line items dynamically** on the quote form — `+ Add line` button and a per-row × delete button (refuses to leave fewer than one row, just clears it instead).
- **Live totals on the quote form** — subtotal, tax, and total all recompute as you type quantity, unit price, or tax rate.
- **Tax rate now defaults from PSA settings** (`SystemSetting.psa_default_tax_rate`) on new quotes and invoices. Existing rows preserve their saved value.
- **Default currency** for new invoices comes from `SystemSetting.psa_default_currency`.
- **PSA dropdown gains a Clients link** pointing to `accounts:organization_list` — clients and organizations are the same thing in the data model, so this is a navigation convenience rather than a duplicate view.
- **Removed scope-banner nag** from the cross-client list pages (Dispatch, Invoices, Projects, Recurring, Approvals, Contracts, Email Ingestion, Quotes, Workflow Rules). Those views show data across all clients in global view; they don't need the "Pick a client first" prompt.

### Added
- `SystemSetting.psa_default_tax_rate` (Decimal, default 0) and `psa_default_currency` (CharField, default 'USD').

## [3.17.96] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 8: Invoices, Payments, Accounting integrations, Quote e-signature
A complete billing pipeline plus customer-facing quote signing.

- **Invoices** (`psa.Invoice` + `InvoiceLineItem`) — auto-numbered `INV-YYYY-NNNNN`, draft → sent → partial → paid → overdue → void lifecycle, tax rate with auto subtotal/tax/total, `balance` property, source pointers to a quote / ticket / contract.
- **Payments** (`psa.Payment`) — record a payment against an invoice; saving auto-calls `Invoice.recompute_totals()` which updates `amount_paid` and flips status to partial / paid as appropriate.
- **Generate-from-ticket** — one button on the ticket detail creates a draft invoice from the ticket's billable time entries (priced at the active contract's hourly rate) and billable expenses.
- **AccountingConnection** (`integrations.AccountingConnection`) — per-organization OAuth2 connection with encrypted credentials (client_id + client_secret + refresh_token + tenant/realm IDs all stored in a single AES-encrypted JSON blob).
- **QuickBooks Online provider** — full OAuth2 (authorize → callback → refresh-rotation), customer-by-name lookup with auto-create fallback (mapping cached on the connection), and Invoice push via `/v3/company/<realm>/invoice`. `record_payment()` posts to `/payment` with a LinkedTxn back to the invoice.
- **Xero provider** — OAuth2 with `offline_access` for refresh tokens, tenant_id discovery via `/connections`, Contact upsert, Invoice push to `/api.xro/2.0/Invoices`, Payment push to `/Payments`.
- **Quote e-signature** (`psa.QuoteSignature`) — public, no-login customer URL `/portal/quote/<token>/sign/` with an HTML5 canvas signature pad. POST records the base64-PNG signature, signer name/email/title, IP address, and user-agent, then auto-flips the quote to `accepted` and creates the converted ticket. Quote list page has a one-click **Copy Sign URL** button.

### Changed — Dispatch board shows everything
- Removed the `is_terminal=False` filter — closed/resolved tickets now appear too (rendered with a grey priority badge so you can still distinguish at a glance).
- Removed the 7-day window cap. Tickets without a due date or with a due date outside the next week land in a new **Other** column on the right.

### Cleanup — untracked `.gradle/` build cache
- Removed 21,220 stale Gradle wrapper / cache files from the index that were committed before `.gradle/` was added to `.gitignore`. Local files are kept; future clones drop ~3.8GB.

## [3.17.95] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed — Dispatch board dark-mode contrast + size
- Replaced fixed `table-light` / `table-warning` with theme-aware `var(--bs-tertiary-bg)` so the grid renders correctly in both light and dark modes.
- Compressed the layout: smaller fonts (.8rem header / .75rem cards / .7rem subject), tighter padding, narrower tech column (110px), `table-layout: fixed`, subjects truncated to 35 chars. The grid is roughly half the visual weight it was.
- Unassigned row uses a small "Unassigned" badge cell rather than colouring the whole row bright yellow.

### Changed — Update script auto-installs PSA defaults + sample workflows
The web-UI **Apply update** button (and `python manage.py auto_update` CLI) now run two extra idempotent commands at the end of every update:

- `psa_seed_defaults` — ensures queues, statuses, priorities, types, and the service catalog exist
- `psa_seed_sample_workflows` — installs the 7 starter rules (P1 escalation, sales-inquiry follow-up, new-user onboarding, termination security routing, outage keyword detection, unassigned triage, client-reply tagging) into every active organization

Both are matched on existing names so re-runs don't duplicate. Failures are logged but non-blocking (don't abort the update).

This is purely a remote-script change — `deploy/update_instructions.sh` is downloaded from `main` on every update, so any installation gets the new behavior on its next Apply with no code change required on the box.

## [3.17.94] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 7: SLA matrix UI + Workflow Rules + Dispatch Board

- **SLA matrix editor** on the contract form — a P1–P5 grid where each cell holds an optional response/resolution override in minutes. The SLA engine (`psa.sla.compute_due_dates`) checks the active contract's matrix before falling back to the priority's defaults, so premium clients can have tighter SLAs than the global queue defaults.
- **Workflow Rules engine** (`psa.WorkflowRule`) — JSON-DSL rule engine fired from PSA signals on `ticket_created` / `ticket_updated` / `status_changed` / `comment_added`. Conditions support `priority`, `queue`, `status`, `subject_contains`, `is_unassigned`, `is_paused`, `__in` / `__not` operators, plus `all` / `any` combinators. Actions: `set_priority`, `set_queue`, `assign_to`, `add_watcher`, `add_internal_note`, `add_tag`. Misconfigured rules capture `last_error` on the row instead of blocking ticket save.
- **Sample workflow installer** — `psa_seed_sample_workflows` management command installs 7 starter rules per organization (P1 escalation, sales-inquiry follow-up, new-user onboarding, termination security routing, outage keyword detection, unassigned triage, client-reply tagging). Tenant-scoped + idempotent.
- **Dispatch Board** at `/psa/dispatch/` — 7-day grid of open tickets bucketed by due date with one row per tech, an unassigned row at the top, and an overdue panel above the grid.

### Added — Python Dependency Scanner remediation
- New superuser-only **Upgrade** button on the Python scanner dashboard. Clicking it opens a modal with the package name + a dropdown limited to the `fix_versions` from the most recent scan.
- New `/core/security/python-scanner/remediate/` POST endpoint runs `pip install --upgrade <name>==<version>` in a controlled subprocess (300 s timeout, package + version regex-validated, version must be in the published fix list to prevent stale-dashboard exploitation). Audit-logged success and failure with stdout/stderr tails.
- The modal explicitly tells the admin to (a) update `requirements.txt` and (b) restart gunicorn — we don't auto-restart since the request is in-process.

### Tests
+7 in `psa.tests.Phase7WorkflowTests` covering SLA matrix override math, set_priority on subject match, condition false → no-op, add_tag action, inactive rule no-op, error-capture for bogus action types, and sample-workflow seeding.

## [3.17.93] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 6: project tasks + ticket-detail polish
- **Project tasks** (`psa.ProjectTask`) — task/milestone breakdown under any Project, with status (todo / in_progress / blocked / done / cancelled), assignee, due date, milestone flag, and parent-task hierarchy. Inline add + status-update + delete on the project detail page.
- **Ticket detail surfaces:**
  - **Active contract banner** showing client name, contract type, hours used / total / remaining, and a warning chip when allowance is depleted.
  - **Expenses card** (per-ticket reimbursable / billable expenses) with inline add form (amount, currency, category, billable + reimbursable flags, optional receipt upload), running list, and a footer total of billable amounts.

### Fixed
- `psa.tests.ServiceCatalogTests.test_create_from_catalog_prefills` was asserting against the old subject-input behavior. Updated to check that the catalog item's `fields_json` labels render (the new structured-fields path that's been live since v3.17.87).
- Replaced deprecated `AXES_LOCK_OUT_BY_COMBINATION_USER_AND_IP` with `AXES_LOCKOUT_PARAMETERS = [['username', 'ip_address']]` (same behavior, no startup warning).

## [3.17.92] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 5: Quotes / Estimates + Expenses
- **Quotes** (`psa.Quote` + `QuoteLineItem`) — auto-numbered `Q-YYYY-NNNNN`, draft → sent → accepted/rejected/expired lifecycle, tax rate + auto-computed subtotal/tax/total, line items, and **convert-to-ticket on acceptance**. PSA dropdown gains a Quotes entry.
- **Expenses** (`psa.TicketExpense`) — per-ticket reimbursable / billable expense rows with category (mileage, parts, software, subcontractor, shipping, other), amount + currency, optional receipt file upload, audit-logged on add. Expenses can be tied to a `PSAApproval` for manager sign-off.

### Tests
+5 in `psa.tests.Phase5QuotesExpensesTests` covering auto-quote-numbering, line-item math + tax, accept→ticket conversion, accept-without-ticket, and expense creation.

## [3.17.91] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 4: Customer Portal + Email-to-Ticket + Contracts
Three more substantial pieces. PSA dropdown gains Contracts and Email Ingestion. New top-level `/portal/` is a stripped layout for clients only.

- **Customer Portal** (`portal/` app at `/portal/`) — clients log in, see only their org's tickets where `client_can_view=True`, post replies as public comments, submit new tickets. Internal-only comments and attachments are filtered at queryset time. Per-org opt-in via `ClientPSASettings.portal_enabled`. Stripped layout with no MSP nav.
- **Email-to-Ticket** (`psa.EmailIngestionConfig`) — IMAP poller. Per-org mailbox config with encrypted password (vault-style). `psa_poll_email` management command (cron every 5 min) fetches UNSEEN messages, threads replies onto existing tickets when subject matches the configured ticket-number regex, otherwise creates new tickets with `source='email'`. Marks each message as Seen.
- **Contracts** (`psa.Contract`) — per-client agreement (block_hours / retainer / managed_services / per_incident) with hours allowance, hourly rate, overage rate, and a per-priority SLA matrix override. `Contract.for_ticket(ticket)` returns the active contract (status='active', within date range). `TicketTimeEntry.save()` increments `Contract.hours_used_minutes` automatically — only on stop transitions, not while a timer is still running. Hooks into AuditLog for every CRUD.

### Models
`psa.Contract`, `psa.EmailIngestionConfig`. `TicketComment` gets `author_name` / `author_email` / `source` columns so external (email/portal) replies get attributed even without a User row.

### Tests
+10 in `psa.tests.Phase4FeaturesTests` and `psa.tests.CustomerPortalTests` covering contract activation rules, time-entry → contract hour accounting, email password encryption, portal queryset filtering of staff-only tickets, internal-comment hiding on detail view, portal reply-creation, and portal ticket creation.

## [3.17.90] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 3: full-featured push
Adds four major missing pieces. PSA dropdown gets four new entries (Projects, Recurring Tickets, Knowledge Base, Approvals).

- **Projects** (`psa.Project`) — group tickets under a delivery effort with status (planning/active/on_hold/completed/cancelled), owner, billable flag, estimated hours, start/due dates, optional client_org. New routes `/psa/projects/`, `/psa/projects/new/`, `/psa/projects/<pk>/`, `/psa/projects/<pk>/edit/`. Ticket gets `project` FK.
- **Recurring tickets** (`psa.RecurringTicketSchedule`) — preventive-maintenance template with frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly) × interval. New `psa_run_recurring_tickets` management command for cron (recommended every 15 min). Generated tickets carry `recurring_schedule` FK + `source='recurring'` and roll `next_run_at` forward by one cycle. Catch-up cap of 50 tickets per overdue schedule prevents runaway after a long downtime.
- **Knowledge Base** browser at `/psa/kb/` — searches `docs.Document` filtered to `is_global=True`. New `psa.TicketKBLink` through-table allows many KB articles per ticket; link/unlink endpoints on ticket detail.
- **Approvals** (`psa.PSAApproval`) — generic manager-approval gate for time / expense / quote / order / AI-action / change. List + decide UI at `/psa/approvals/`. `approval.decide(user, approved, comment)` helper writes status + decided_at atomically.

### Tests
6 new tests in `psa.tests.Phase3FeaturesTests` covering slug auto-gen, completed_at auto-set, monthly relativedelta math, the cron command actually creating a ticket and rolling next_run_at, approval decision atomicity, and KB-link uniqueness.

## [3.17.89] - 2026-04-28

### Added — Distributors: Pax8 + TD Synnex adapters
- **Pax8** provider (`pax8`) — OAuth2 client-credentials, `/v1/products` catalog, product detail pricing (price bands), `/v1/orders` placement, HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification on `X-Pax8-Signature`. SaaS-distributor-shaped: catalogs are unlimited unless deactivated.
- **TD Synnex** provider (`synnex`) — OAuth2 to `/apis/v2/oauth/token`, price-availability lookup, order placement, HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification on `X-TDS-Signature`.
- Distributors card surfaced on the main Integrations page so admins discover the feature without typing the URL.

## [3.17.88] - 2026-04-28

### Added — PSA Phase 2c remainder
- **Similar tickets** card on the ticket detail page (same-asset + Jaccard token overlap on subject) so techs can spot duplicates and one-click merge.
- **`@mention` parser** — typing `@username` or `@user@example.com` in a comment auto-adds them as a watcher and emails them.
- **Ticket merge** moves comments + attachments to the target ticket, marks the source as a duplicate, and audit-logs both.

### Added — Distributors (Workstream 8)
- **`integrations.DistributorConnection` + `DistributorWebhookEvent`** with encrypted credentials/secrets, opaque per-connection webhook tokens, and tenant scoping.
- **Ingram Micro Xvantage** adapter — OAuth2 client-credentials, catalog list, price + availability, order placement (gated by `sync_enabled`, off by default), HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification.
- **Six other distributors** (TD Synnex, D&H, ScanSource, Pax8, QBS, Westcoast) reserved as `provider_type` choices for future adapters.
- **Admin UI** — list, create/edit, delete, ad-hoc pricing lookup, connection test endpoint.
- **`sync_distributors` management command** for cron health probes.

### Added — PSA AI Phase 10c
- **11 granular RoleTemplate booleans** (`psa_ai_view`, `_send_low_risk`, `_send_high_risk`, `_approve_reply`, `_apply_low_risk`, `_apply_high_risk`, `_approve_action`, `_run_script`, `_create_workflow`, `_billing`, `_admin`) and a data migration backfilling the seven system templates per the role matrix.
- `psa_ai/permissions.py` resolver was already wired for these — now reads authoritative values rather than falling back to simple-role heuristics.

## [3.17.77] - 2026-04-28

### UX
- **Friendly "Pick a client" page on `/psa/new/` in global view** — used to return 404 (hostile, no recovery path). Now renders the scope-banner picker plus a centered "Pick a client first" card. If the active client is auto-opted-out (external PSA detected), redirects to the ticket list with a flash message naming the client.

## [3.17.76] - 2026-04-28

### UX — PSA scope clarity (Option A)
- **Scope banner on every PSA page** (`templates/psa/_scope_banner.html`):
  - When a client is selected: subtle green-bordered chip with the client name and an inline Switch dropdown (jump between clients without leaving PSA).
  - In global view (no current_organization, superuser/staff only): sticky yellow banner stating "you're seeing data across all clients" with a "Pick a client" picker.
- **Color-coded client pills** in the ticket list — same client always renders the same hue (HSL derived from organization id) so scanning rows for a given client is easy.
- **"New Ticket" + "Client Settings" disabled in global view** with tooltip pointing at the picker.
- **Client badge moved out of subtitle text** on the detail page — now a colored pill next to the ticket number.

### Hard rule
- **External PSA = absolute opt-out for native PSA** — there's no admin override path that re-enables native when an active `integrations.PSAConnection` exists. To use native PSA for a client, deactivate the external connection first. The override checkbox on the per-client settings page is now visually locked OFF when an external PSA is detected.

## [3.17.75] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **Native PSA auto-opts-out clients that already have an external PSA** — `integrations.PSAConnection` (ConnectWise / Halo / Autotask / Freshservice / Kaseya / Syncro / Zendesk / etc.) on an org auto-disables the native PSA for that client. No manual toggle.
- `ClientPSASettings` is now an OVERRIDE rather than an opt-in step. Visiting the per-client page no longer auto-creates a row — absence of a row means "use auto-detection". Page surfaces the auto-decision with a banner, plus a "Reset to auto-detect" button to delete an override row.

## [3.17.74] - 2026-04-28

### Security
- **HSTS `includeSubDomains` is now opt-in** via the `SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS` env var (default False). It used to auto-cascade at any HSTS value, which would have force-applied HTTPS-only to every sibling subdomain — hard to undo because the browser caches it for the HSTS lifetime.
- `.env.bak.*` is now gitignored so secret-rotation backup files never get committed by accident.

## [3.17.73] - 2026-04-28

### UX — PSA
- **Global PSA toggle now cascades to every client by default.** Per-client `ClientPSASettings.enabled` defaults to True; the page becomes opt-OUT instead of opt-in.
- The genuinely sensitive per-surface flags (portal, anonymous form, SMS, desktop alerts, email-to-ticket, external alert ingest) remain OFF by default — those still require deliberate per-client enable.

## [3.17.72] - 2026-04-28

### Bug Fixes
- **Fix DRF schema crash that returned 500 across the entire site whenever `DEBUG=False`** — `DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS` was set to `None` outside DEBUG mode, which caused `rest_framework.schemas.coreapi.is_enabled()` to call `issubclass(None, AutoSchema)` → `TypeError`. This was the root cause of the `/account/login/` 500 in production. Pinned `DEFAULT_SCHEMA_CLASS` to the modern OpenAPI AutoSchema unconditionally.

### New Features
- **PSA toggle in Settings → Features** — the `psa_enabled` flag was wired into `core.SystemSetting` and the context processor in 3.17.70/71 but no UI control existed. Adds a labeled switch with an "off by default" badge.

## [3.17.71] - 2026-04-28

### Security
- **Bump remaining direct Python deps to clear `pip-audit` warnings**:
  - Django `>=6.0.4` (7 advisories incl. SQL injection, timing attack, DoS chains)
  - cryptography `>=46.0.7` (2 advisories beyond the previous SECT-curve floor)
- **Pin transitive security floors**: `Authlib>=1.6.11` (alg:none JWT bypass), `nltk>=3.9.4` (5 advisories), `pyasn1>=0.6.3` (GHSA-jr27-m4p2-rc6r). `pip-audit` now clean against the venv.
- Untrack `.pip-audit-cache/` from git — 105 stale cache files were tracked and churning on every scan.

## [3.17.70] - 2026-04-27

### New Features
- **Native PSA / Service Desk — Phase 1 foundation** (off by default, fully gated). New `psa` Django app distinct from the existing `integrations.PSATicket` (which mirrors third-party PSA syncs).
  - Models: `Ticket` (full field set, auto-numbered `PSA-YYYY-NNNNNN`), `Queue`, `TicketStatus`, `TicketPriority`, `TicketType`, `TicketComment` (with `is_internal` flag preserved for Phase 3 portal), `TicketAttachment` (tenant-scoped upload path), `ClientPSASettings` (per-tenant enable + per-surface flags).
  - Feature flags: `core.SystemSetting.psa_enabled` (global), `psa.ClientPSASettings.enabled` (per-client). Helpers: `is_psa_enabled`, `is_psa_enabled_for_client`, `@require_psa_enabled`, `@require_client_psa_enabled`. Routes return 404 (not redirect) when disabled — avoids leaking existence.
  - `psa_seed_defaults` mgmt command seeds 7 queues, 10 statuses, 5 priorities (P1..P5 with spec-default SLA targets), 14 types.
  - Tenant scoping via existing `core.middleware.get_request_organization`. Audit log via `audit.AuditLog.log()` on every mutation. RBAC via `core.decorators.@require_write`. Sidebar entry hidden via context-processor flag. Migrations `core.0043` (`psa_enabled`) and `psa.0001` (initial app).
  - 11 PSA tests covering disabled-by-default, per-client opt-in, auto-numbered tickets, audit log writes, cross-tenant isolation, seed idempotency.
- **Secure vault context page for tickets** (`/psa/t/<ticket_number>/context/`):
  - Read-only metadata view of the ticket organization's vault entries. Each row has an "Open in Vault" button with `target="_blank" rel="noopener"` linking to the existing `vault:password_detail` view (which enforces its own permission and audit checks).
  - **Never inlines secret values** or loads encrypted columns — restricted via `.only(...)`. Asserted by `test_vault_context_does_not_render_secret_values` (response body cannot contain `encrypted_password`, `decrypt`, or sample plaintext).
  - Right-rail "Vault Context" panel on the ticket detail page shows the top 5 entries with a "View all" footer.
  - Every page open writes `AuditLog(action='read', object_type='psa.TicketContext')` — every vault context open is auditable.
- **Admin warning system on Security Dashboard** — unified panel surfacing OS package security updates, Python dependency vulnerabilities (new `pip-audit`-driven scanner at `/core/security/python-scanner/`), app-version-behind, and expiring SSL/domain certs. Severity-sorted with deep-link actions. Right-rail Python deps tile mirrors the OS tile.
- **Scheduled `python_dep_scan` task** (enabled, daily) and `system_warnings_digest` task (opt-in, requires SMTP). Digest reuses the vault password expiry notification pattern; `SystemWarningNotification` tracks already-notified warning IDs to prevent re-spam.

### Security
- **Patch 4 Python dependency CVEs** (Dependabot):
  - Pillow `12.1.* → 12.2.0+` (high: FITS GZIP decompression bomb)
  - python-dotenv `1.0.* → 1.2.2+` (symlink-follow arbitrary file overwrite)
  - requests `2.32.* → 2.33.0+` (insecure temp file reuse)
  - markdown `3.5.* → 3.8.1+` (uncaught exception DoS)

## [3.17.69] - 2026-04-27

### Internal
- Ignore local `projects/` side-project directory so unrelated side-projects don't show up as untracked in `git status`.

## [3.17.68] - 2026-04-27

### New Features
- **Vault password expiration dates with alerts** — vault items already had an `expires_at` field on the model; this release wires it end-to-end:
  - **Expiry badges on vault list** — expired passwords show a red "Expired" badge; passwords expiring within 14 days show an amber "Expires in Xd" badge alongside the existing security status badge
  - **Email notifications** — new scheduled task (`Vault Password Expiry Notifications`, runs daily) checks for passwords expiring within the configured warning window and emails superusers and org admins. Notification flag resets automatically if the expiry date is changed, so alerts re-fire with the new date
  - **Settings** — new "Send vault password expiration warnings" toggle and "Password Expiry Warning (days)" field in Settings → SMTP & Notifications (default: 14 days)
  - **Migration** — adds `notify_on_password_expiry` and `password_expiry_warning_days` to `SystemSetting`

## [3.17.67] - 2026-04-27

### Bug Fixes
- **"View AI Doc" / "View Profile" 404 from asset detail (#126)** — both document buttons used `asset.ai_document.pk` and `asset.profile_document.pk` in the `{% url 'docs:document_detail' %}` tag, but that URL pattern takes a `slug`, not a PK. Django matched the numeric PK as a slug string and the view's `get_object_or_404(Document, slug=slug)` found no match. Fixed to use `.slug`.
- **ITFlow sync datetime comparison error (#125)** — `updated_since` is passed as a timezone-naive datetime but ITFlow API timestamps are parsed as timezone-aware (UTC). Comparing the two raises `TypeError: can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes`. Fixed in `list_companies`, `list_contacts`, and `list_tickets` by making the naive `updated_since` timezone-aware (UTC) before comparing. Thanks to HabeasPorpoise for the root cause analysis and fix.

## [3.17.66] - 2026-04-22

### Bug Fixes
- **Changelog not rendering on updates page** — `|escapejs` was used in an HTML `data-` attribute; it backslash-escapes double quotes (`\"`), which truncated the attribute value at the first `"` in the changelog text. Changed to `|escape` (HTML entity encoding); browsers automatically decode entities when reading `dataset` properties in JavaScript.

## [3.17.65] - 2026-04-22

### New Features
- **Release notes on the Updates page (#124)** — the System Updates page now shows a rendered changelog for the current version ("What's in vX.Y.Z") and a collapsible per-version list of everything that changed between the running version and the latest available update. Each version entry is expandable and tagged with New / Fix / Improved badges. CHANGELOG.md is now fully populated from v3.17.27 onwards.

## [3.17.64] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes
- **Copy button "Error fetching password" on HTTP installs (#122)** — `navigator.clipboard` is `undefined` in non-HTTPS (plain HTTP) browser contexts; calling `.writeText()` threw synchronously inside the fetch `.then()` handler, which propagated to the outer `.catch()` and showed the misleading "Error fetching password" alert. Added a `copyToClipboard()` helper that uses the Clipboard API when available and falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')` for plain-HTTP installs. Applies to username, password, and OTP copy buttons.

## [3.17.63] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes
- **API diagnostic table leaking into generated UniFi documentation (#105)** — when traffic rules were empty and legacy credentials were present, the generated HTML document embedded the raw API endpoint diagnostic table (path attempts, auth methods, status codes). This is debug data that belongs only on the integration sync detail page. Generated documents now show a clean "No traffic rules found." message.

## [3.17.62] - 2026-04-20

### Bug Fixes
- **Traffic Routes section hidden when empty in UniFi detail page (#105)** — the Traffic Routes / App Rules section used `{% if site.traffic_routes %}` which hid the section entirely when no routes were found, giving the impression of a discrepancy vs. the generated documentation (which always renders both sections). Now always shown with "No traffic routes configured." empty state, matching Traffic Rules behaviour.

## [3.17.61] - 2026-04-18

### New Features
- **Per-site Import button for UniFi cloud connections (#105)** — each site card on the cloud connection detail page now shows an Import button (when an org is assigned to that site) allowing devices to be imported into the assigned organisation directly without using the bulk import flow.

## [3.17.60] - 2026-04-18

### New Features
- **UniFi cloud import per-site org routing (#105)** — when importing from a cloud connection, devices are now grouped by their assigned organisation and imported into the correct org rather than the session org. Sites without an org assignment are skipped.
- **Zone API diagnostic (#105)** — added `_zone_diag` tracking to the UniFi zone lookup; shown as a yellow diagnostic card in the sync detail page when no zone names can be resolved, listing every API path attempted.

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi cross-org 404 on cloud connections (#105)** — `get_object_or_404(UnifiConnection, pk=pk, organization=org)` failed when the session org differed from the connection's org. Replaced with `_get_unifi_connection()` helper that bypasses the org filter for superusers and staff.

## [3.17.59] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes
- **Whitelabeling site name not applying to page titles (#119, #120)** — child templates each define `{% block title %}` which completely overrides the parent `base.html` block, bypassing the dynamic brand expression. All 193 templates had hardcoded "Client St0r" in their title blocks. Bulk-replaced with the dynamic expression `{{ system_settings.custom_company_name|default:system_settings.site_name|default:"Client St0r" }}`.

## [3.17.58] - 2026-04-17

### Bug Fixes
- **Site name / custom company name not updating browser tab or login page (#119, #120)** — `base.html` had a hardcoded title; `two_factor/_base_focus.html` had hardcoded "Client St0r" in both the `<title>` and `<h1>`. Both updated to use `system_settings.custom_company_name|default:system_settings.site_name|default:"Client St0r"` via the `organization_context` context processor which is available on all pages including unauthenticated login.

## [3.17.57] - 2026-04-15

### Bug Fixes
- **Vault password reveal/copy/breach/TOTP return 404 in Global View (#119)** — `password_reveal`, `password_test_breach`, `generate_otp_api`, and the OTP QR view all used `get_object_or_404(Password, pk=pk, organization=org)` which fails when `org=None` (Global View mode). Added global view guard matching the existing pattern in `password_detail`: superusers and staff in Global View fetch by PK only.

## [3.17.56] - 2026-04-15

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi cloud connection 404 (#105)** — sync, test, and import views used `get_object_or_404(UnifiConnection, pk=pk, organization=org)` which fails for cloud connections whose org differs from the session org. Extracted `_get_unifi_connection()` helper.
- **Firewall policy crash on Network 10.x (#105)** — `html.escape()` was called on the `action` field which can be a `dict` in Network 10.x (`{"type": "ACCEPT"}`). Added type-safety to extract the `type`/`name` key before escaping.
- **Zone names showing as numeric IDs (#105)** — enhanced zone resolution to check inline `zoneName`/`name` fields within policy source/destination objects as a fallback when the zones API returns no results. Also added more API path variants including `firewall/zones` and legacy `networkconf` endpoint.

## [3.17.55] - 2026-04-14

### New Features
- **Import job dry-run promote (#105)** — added `import_promote` view and confirmation page so dry-run import jobs can be promoted to real imports without re-uploading. Added `skip_duplicates` boolean field to `ImportJob` model (migration included).

## [3.17.54] - 2026-04-13

### Bug Fixes
- **Missing `unifi_connections.mode` column on fresh installs** — migration was missing on clean database setups; added explicit migration to ensure the `mode` column is created.

## [3.17.53] - 2026-04-13

### Bug Fixes
- **Vault list hardcoded URLs** — vault list templates used hardcoded `/vault/passwords/` paths instead of `{% url %}` tags, breaking installs with a custom `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`.

## [3.17.52] - 2026-04-12

### Bug Fixes
- **Membership import failure** — CSV import for memberships was failing on missing field mapping.
- **Vault password create decrypt error** — password creation form was not correctly handling the encryption round-trip on save.
- **Software not appearing in device profiles** — software list was excluded from the profile document template context.

## [3.17.51] - 2026-04-12

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi `TemplateSyntaxError`** — a template tag syntax error in the UniFi detail page caused a 500 on render.
- **AI blueprint software display** — software section was not rendering in AI-generated blueprint documents.

## [3.17.50] - 2026-04-11

### New Features
- **UniFi cloud site org assignment** — added per-site organisation dropdown on the cloud connection detail page; selections are saved to `site_org_map` (JSONField) and used during import to route devices to the correct org.

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi zone names still showing as IDs** — added int/string coercion for zone ID lookups and additional fallback: extract zone name from within policy `source`/`destination` objects when the zones API is unavailable.
- **Traffic rule display** — improved normalisation of traffic rule entries from the integration v1 API format.

## [3.17.49] - 2026-04-11

### Bug Fixes
- **Traffic routes list crash** — `traffic_routes` was not always a list; added defensive type check.
- **Zone ID lookup** — improved zone map key coercion (int and string keys) to handle mixed-type IDs returned by different firmware versions.
- **AI blueprint software format** — software entries were being rendered as raw Python repr instead of a readable list.

## [3.17.48] - 2026-04-10

### New Features
- **Software list in AI blueprint** — installed software is now included in the AI-generated device documentation blueprint.

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi cloud devices still empty** — `_get_all` only checked the `data` response key; the Site Manager API can return results under `items`, `devices`, or as a bare list; now tries all known key names.
- **UniFi traffic rules error** — additional error handling for traffic rules endpoint on cloud connections.

## [3.17.47] - 2026-04-10

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM software sync missing connection FK (#113)** — software sync was creating `InstalledSoftware` records without setting the `rmm_connection` foreign key, causing integrity errors.
- **UniFi zone names (#105)** — further improvements to zone name resolution from multiple API response shapes.

## [3.17.46] - 2026-04-10

### New Features
- **Default organisation preference (#115)** — users can now set a default organisation that is auto-selected on login.

### Bug Fixes
- **Organisation location bugs (#116)** — fixed several edge cases in org location display and editing.

## [3.17.45] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes
- **Apply update returning HTML 500 instead of JSON** — the update apply endpoint was returning an HTML error page on import errors instead of a JSON response, breaking the JS update flow.

## [3.17.44] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes
- **Update check 500 on older DB schemas** — `AuditLog` query referenced `extra_data` column which did not exist on pre-migration databases; added `try/except` guard.

## [3.17.43] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi Network 8.x+ zone policy paths** — added non-REST zone-policy paths for Network 8.x firmware; improved endpoint discovery probe to cover more firmware generations.

## [3.17.42] - 2026-04-09

### New Features
- **Asset health indicators** — age warnings (configurable threshold), firmware version tracking, and warranty expiry checks added to the asset list and detail views.

## [3.17.41] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi firewall policy path variants (#105)** — added additional path attempts for Network 10.x firewall policies including `security/firewall-policies`, `security/zone-policies`, and integration v1 variants.

## [3.17.40] - 2026-04-09

### New Features
- **Contact ratings and tech notes** — organisations now support per-contact difficulty ratings and free-text technician notes.

### Bug Fixes
- **Service button colours** — fixed incorrect CSS class on service quick-info buttons.

## [3.17.39] - 2026-04-09

### New Features
- **Service quick-info buttons** — organisation detail page now shows quick-info buttons for configured integrations (TRMM, UniFi, M365, etc.).

## [3.17.38] - 2026-04-09

### Improvements
- **Signal-bar rating UI** — replaced SVG gauge graphics with a cleaner CSS signal-bar component for support difficulty ratings.

## [3.17.37] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes
- **Support ratings 403** — permission check was too restrictive; relaxed to allow org-scoped staff to submit ratings.

## [3.17.36] - 2026-04-09

### Bug Fixes
- **Incorrect stat text in consult and about templates** — removed copy that referenced a wrong window/context.

## [3.17.35] - 2026-04-09

### New Features
- **Free consultation request form** — public-facing form for prospective clients to submit consultation requests; submissions appear in the admin dashboard.

## [3.17.34] - 2026-04-08

### New Features
- **Support difficulty ratings** — organisations can be rated for support complexity; ratings are shown on the org list and detail pages to help technicians set expectations.

## [3.17.33] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM software sync (#113)** — expanded endpoint path attempts and fixed sync to process all devices rather than stopping after the first successful response.

## [3.17.32] - 2026-04-08

### New Features
- **UniFi Traffic Routes section** — added Traffic Routes / App Rules (Network 10.x website/app blocking) as a separate section in the UniFi sync detail page and generated documentation.

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi zone name display (#105)** — improved zone name rendering in the firewall policy table.
- **TRMM software message** — corrected empty-state message when no software is found.

## [3.17.31] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM software sync UUID vs PK (#113)** — sync was passing the numeric database PK to the TRMM API instead of the agent UUID; fixed to use the correct identifier.

## [3.17.30] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi zone policy template crash (#105)** — template referenced `site.zone_policies` before it was populated; added guard. Fixed `zone_id` field mapping to handle both string and integer zone IDs.

## [3.17.29] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi endpoint discovery (#105)** — added probe step that tests available API paths before syncing, reducing 404 noise in logs. Added Network 10.x path variants for zone policies and traffic rules.

## [3.17.28] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi legacy session auth (#105)** — fixed session cookie handling for legacy REST auth on older UniFi firmware; expanded path probing to include more site reference formats.

## [3.17.27] - 2026-04-08

### New Features
- **UniFi firewall/traffic rule diagnostics (#105)** — added `_tr_diag` and `_fp_diag` diagnostic tracking to the UniFi sync; shown in the sync detail page when rules cannot be retrieved, listing every API path attempted with status codes.

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi legacy site ref fallback (#105)** — added `internalReference` → `name` → UUID fallback chain for site references passed to the legacy REST API.

## [3.17.26] - 2026-04-08

### Bug Fixes
- **Ollama "Unknown LLM provider" error (#112)** — `AIDocumentationGenerator` had a hardcoded `elif` chain for known providers and raised `ValueError` for `ollama`; added the `ollama` case to read `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL` from settings
- **UniFi zone policies / traffic rules blank on Network 10.x (#105)** — UniFi Network 9.x/10.x moved firewall and traffic rule endpoints under a `security/` path prefix; added `security/zone-policies`, `security/policies`, `security/firewall-policies`, `security/traffic-rules`, and `security/trafficrules` paths to the attempt list for both v2 API key and legacy session cookie auth

## [3.17.25] - 2026-04-07

### Bug Fixes
- **M365 OneDrive display name blank (#106)** — Microsoft's OneDrive usage CSV uses `Owner Display Name` and `Owner Principal Name` as column headers, not `Display Name` / `User Principal Name` as the mailbox report does; fixed column name mapping so names and emails appear correctly
- **UniFi cloud devices (#105)** — added a third fallback: extract device inventory embedded in `host.reportedState.devices` (the Site Manager API embeds device lists in the host object on some API key scopes where `/v1/devices` is restricted)
- **UniFi local rules (#105)** — added integration v1 API paths (`/proxy/network/integration/v1/sites/{id}/trafficRules` and `.../firewallPolicies`) as additional attempts; these accept the X-API-Key and may work on newer UniFi OS firmware without requiring username/password

## [3.17.24] - 2026-04-07

### New Features
- **M365 OneDrive storage usage (#106)** — new `get_onedrive_usage()` method fetches per-user OneDrive storage stats (used, allocated, file count, last activity) from the Graph Reports API; shown as a new section in the M365 tenant document alongside SharePoint usage. Requires `Reports.Read.All` permission (same as mailbox usage).
- **Ollama on-premises AI provider (#112)** — added `OllamaProvider` to the multi-LLM system; configure a base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:11434`) and model name in Settings → AI & LLM; no API key required; all inference stays on your infrastructure; test connection button lists available models.

### Bug Fixes
- **UniFi cloud devices still empty (#105)** — `_get_all` only checked the `data` response key; the Site Manager API can return results under `items`, `devices`, or as a bare list; now tries all known key names; also added a `hostIds` (plural) filter param variant as a final fallback.
- **UniFi local traffic rules / zone policies still blank (#105)** — v2 API paths were only tried with the API key, then with session cookie; added a third attempt using the legacy REST paths (`/proxy/network/api/s/{ref}/rest/trafficrule`) with the API key, which works on some firmware versions without needing username/password.

## [3.17.23] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM MAC address (#108)** — `wmi_detail.network_adapter` is a list-of-lists structure (not a flat list); added `_flatten_wmi_list` helper to unwrap the nested lists before extracting MAC addresses; also added `network_config` as a secondary source with `IPEnabled` preference; covers all known TRMM response shapes
- **M365 detail page crash (#106)** — template referenced `mb.mailboxType` which doesn't exist in the mailbox row dict, causing `VariableDoesNotExist`; removed the invalid fallback

## [3.17.22] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **M365 detail page crash (#106)** — template referenced `mb.userDisplayName` which doesn't exist in the mailbox row dict, causing `VariableDoesNotExist`; removed the invalid fallback
- **UniFi local zone policies/traffic rules blank (#105)** — v2 API paths were tried with the UUID (`siteId`) first, but the v2 API typically requires the short internal reference name (e.g. `default`); swapped order so `internalReference` is tried first
- **UniFi cloud no devices (#105)** — added `/v1/hosts/{hostId}/devices` per-host endpoint as primary path before the flat `/v1/devices?hostId=` query param approach

## [3.17.21] - 2026-04-05

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM MAC address (#108)** — bulk `/agents/` response may return `mac_addresses: [""]` (list with one empty string) which is truthy; `_has_mac` was True so the detail fetch was skipped and the real `MACAddress` from `/agents/{id}/` was never retrieved; fixed by requiring non-empty entries in the list
- **M365 mailbox data (#106)** — rewrote `get_mailbox_usage` to decode blob CSV with `utf-8-sig` (handles BOM), strip per-row BOM artifacts, handle `Storage Used (Bytes)` column name variant, and log what was received when 0 rows parse; removed unreliable `$format=application/json` parameter
- **UniFi zone policies blank (#105)** — `_parse` for firewall policies and traffic rules only checked a few response keys; added all known UniFi API wrapper key variants (`zonePolicies`, `zone_policies`, `firewallPolicies`, `trafficRules`, `traffic_rules`, `rules`)

## [3.17.20] - 2026-04-03

### Bug Fixes
- **M365 Defender alerts not showing (#106)** — `alerts_v2` endpoint does not support `$orderby`; the 400 error was silently swallowed returning an empty list; removed `$orderby` and dropped unsupported `userStates` from `$select`
- **UniFi cloud mode note** — updated to mention zone policies / traffic rules and explain how to get them via a self-hosted connection

## [3.17.19] - 2026-04-03

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM MAC address (#108)** — also scan `wmi_detail.network_adapters` and `wmi_detail.network_config` for MAC; added `MACAddress` (capitalized) as NIC-level field variant
- **M365 mailbox data (#106)** — Graph reporting endpoint redirects to a blob SAS URL; `requests` strips the `Authorization` header on cross-domain redirects causing a spurious 403; now follows the redirect manually without auth header
- **UniFi cloud no devices (#105)** — flat `/v1/devices` endpoint may return empty without explicit `hostId`; now fetches devices per-host first, falling back to flat endpoint only if per-host yields nothing

## [3.17.18] - 2026-04-03

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM MAC address still missing (#108)** — TRMM API returns network interfaces under `interfaces` key, not `nics`; normalize_device was scanning an empty list; added `interfaces` as fallback so MAC is now extracted correctly
- **UniFi local APs still "other" (#105)** — newer U6/U7 series APs have model prefix `u6`/`u7`, not `uap`; added U6, U7, U2, UAF, UBB model prefixes to type map
- **UniFi cloud no devices (#105)** — cloud sync only matched devices to sites by `siteId`; if `siteId` is missing or mismatched, all devices were silently dropped; added fallback that groups unmatched devices directly under their host

## [3.17.17] - 2026-04-02

### Bug Fixes
- **TRMM MAC address sync (#108)** — fixed empty-string MAC address never updating on assets; `device.mac_address == ''` is falsy so the update was silently skipped; now correctly checks `is not None`
- **M365 mailbox data missing from document (#106)** — fixed `_build_mailbox_usage()` returning an empty string when permissions are denied (silently omitting the section); now shows a clear permission error card with the required permission name; also shows an informational card when data is empty rather than hiding the section
- **UniFi asset type always "other" (#105)** — added camelCase cloud Site Manager API productType values to `_TYPE_MAP` (`accessPoint`, `networkSwitch`, `securityGateway`, `dreamRouter`, `dreamMachine`, `cloudGateway`, `powerUnit`); the cloud API returns camelCase which lowercased to unsplit words that didn't match the underscore/hyphen entries

## [3.17.14] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Install App / Add to Home Screen page** (`/core/install/`) — no login required, shareable with staff; shows a QR code of the server URL, a downloadable QR PNG, a one-tap Install button (Android Chrome / desktop), and step-by-step Add to Home Screen instructions for Android, iPhone/iPad, and desktop
- **Profile menu updated** — "Install App (PWA)" now links to the new install page instead of a JS-only prompt, making it work correctly on iOS Safari

## [3.17.13] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Phone Home Screen Shortcut for Receipt Scanning** — "Phone Shortcut" button on vehicle Receipts tab opens a modal with a per-vehicle QR code, a copyable direct URL, and step-by-step Add to Home Screen instructions for Android (Chrome) and iOS (Safari)
- **PWA Shortcuts** — manifest.json now includes "Scan Receipt" and "Vehicles" shortcuts; long-pressing the Client St0r icon on Android shows these shortcuts
- **Quick Receipt landing page** (`/vehicles/receipts/quick/`) — vehicle picker that redirects to receipt_create; if only one active vehicle, skips straight to Add Receipt; QR codes in the shortcut modal link here with `?v=<pk>` for direct-to-vehicle access

## [3.17.12] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Receipt duplicate prevention** — receipt images are SHA-256 hashed on OCR extract and on upload; if the same image already exists on any receipt, saving is blocked with a clear error showing the original receipt details

### Improvements
- Receipt form redesigned with Step 1 / Step 2 layout
- Inline duplicate alert replaces browser popup
- "Configure AI key" link next to the AI Extract button points to Settings → AI
- AI state resets when a new image is selected

### Migrations
- `vehicles/migrations/0007_receipt_image_hash.py` — Adds `image_hash` column (db_index) to `vehicle_receipts`

## [3.17.11] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Vehicle Receipt Scanning with AI OCR** - Upload or photograph receipts directly from your phone; Claude vision API extracts vendor, date, amount, tax, category, and odometer reading automatically; AI confidence indicator prompts review of uncertain fields; receipt image stored alongside record
- **Receipt Expense Tracking** - New Receipts tab on vehicle detail page with per-category cost summary cards (Fuel, Maintenance, Repair, Total); full receipt table with category badges and AI indicator; supports all expense categories: fuel, maintenance, repair, insurance, registration, tolls, cleaning, inspection

### Migrations
- `vehicles/migrations/0006_add_vehicle_receipts.py` — Creates `vehicle_receipts` table

## [3.17.10] - 2026-04-02

### Bug Fixes
- **Client org dropdown cut off on smaller screens** — Simplified to single-line pill with smaller font (`.78rem`), tighter padding, `overflow:hidden`, `max-width:180px`, ellipsis truncation on org name

## [3.17.9] - 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Automated Security Scan Scheduling** — New scheduled task (`security_scan`) runs OS package + Snyk vulnerability scans daily (disabled by default); emails all superusers when findings are detected using configured SMTP; toggle on/off from Security Dashboard with next run time and last status display
- **Client/Org Indicator Redesign** — Active organization shown as a distinct amber gradient pill in the navbar with a pulsing dot indicator to draw attention to the active client context

### Bug Fixes
- **Security dashboard scan history contrast** — Improved badge and severity label colors (medium/low/high) for readability in both light and dark themes
- **TRMM MAC address missing after sync** — Per-agent detail fetch was only triggered when RAM/disk data absent; now also triggered when MAC address is missing from list response (fixes #108)
- **M365 mailbox usage data not in generated document** — `_build_mailbox_usage()` function and document section were missing from M365 document generator (fixes #106)
- **UniFi Security Gateway always categorized as "other"** — Added `ugw` to `_TYPE_MAP`; device `model` field now checked as fallback for type detection (fixes #105)
- **IPAM asset link field not functional** — IP address form used `{{ form.asset_id }}` (non-existent); corrected to `{{ form.asset }}`; asset link in subnet detail table now renders as clickable link (fixes #111)

## [3.16.5] - 2026-03-30

### Bug Fixes
- **Navbar main items now centered** - Changed main nav `<ul>` from `navbar-nav` to `navbar-nav mx-auto`; removed `ms-auto` from the right navbar `<ul>` to avoid competing auto-margins. Bootstrap flexbox now distributes equal left/right auto-margins around the main nav, centering Dashboard/Assets/Vault/Docs/Operations/Reports/Admin between the logo and right-side items (search, org switcher, profile)

## [3.16.4] - 2026-03-30

### Bug Fixes
- **Navbar off-center after nav consolidation** - Removed `flex-wrap: wrap` and redundant `display: flex; align-items: center` from `.navbar-container` in `custom.css`; Bootstrap handles the flex layout natively — wrapping was causing the nav to render on two rows and appear misaligned after the Operations dropdown consolidation

## [3.16.3] - 2026-03-30

### New Features
- **Locations integrated into Organizations** - Manage multiple physical locations per organization directly from the organization detail page; removed Locations from the Admin navigation (access is through org → Locations section); each location card shows status badges (Inactive/Planned/Closed) and Edit/Delete buttons for owners and admins; location count badge on section header
- **Streamlined top navigation** - Consolidated Inventory, Scheduling, Monitoring, Vehicles, and Workflows into a single "Operations" dropdown (only shown if at least one of these modules is enabled); removed "Quick Add" from top nav (already on dashboard); removed standalone Locations from Admin dropdown; reduced nav from 12 items to 6 (Dashboard, Assets, Vault, Docs, Operations, Reports, Admin)

### Bug Fixes
- **Vehicle Inventory dark mode contrast** - `inventory_summary.html` replaced all hardcoded light-mode CSS colors (`#f8f9fa`, `white`, `#212529`, `#d1e7dd`, `#f8d7da`) with Bootstrap CSS variables (`--bs-secondary-bg`, `--bs-card-bg`, `--bs-body-color`, `--bs-border-color`); now renders correctly in both light and dark mode

## [3.16.2] - 2026-03-28

### Changes
- **Settings → Integrations** - Moved Integrations link from Admin Management dropdown to Settings sidebar under a dedicated "Integrations" section; removed duplicate from Admin nav
- **Settings sidebar** - Replaced "Vault Import" with "Data Import" in the Settings sidebar link

## [3.16.1] - 2026-03-28

### New Features
- **Data Import with CSV field mapper** - New visual field mapper for importing any CSV/spreadsheet data; supports Assets, Passwords (Vault), Contacts, and Documents as target models; auto-suggests column mappings by name; shows 5-row data preview; `CSVImportService` handles import with deduplication
- **Multi-platform data import** - Import data from Hudu exports, IT Glue exports, MagicPlan floor plans, or any CSV/spreadsheet file; import jobs tracked in database with status and record counts
- **Field mapper UI** - Step-by-step flow: upload file → map fields → import; radio buttons to select target model; per-column dropdowns for destination fields; JavaScript `rebuildSelects()` updates dropdowns when model type changes

### Changes
- **Renamed "Vault Import" → "Data Import"** - Import is no longer vault-specific; all data types supported

### Migrations
- `imports/migrations/0006_csv_import_mapper.py` — Adds `csv_target_model` and `field_mappings` fields to `import_jobs` table

## [3.16.0] - 2026-03-27

### New Features
- **Omada network integration** - TP-Link Omada SDN controller integration: session-based authentication with CSRF token support, paginated API calls, site-aware device discovery; devices mapped to asset types (switch, wireless_ap, gateway, eap); CRUD management + manual sync + import-as-assets; configurable scheduled auto-sync
- **Grandstream network integration** - Grandstream GDMS/UCM integration: Bearer token authentication, paginated device listing with flat fallback for simple deployments; all devices mapped to `wireless_ap` asset type; same CRUD + sync + import flow as UniFi and Omada
- **Network asset auto-sync** - New `sync_network_assets` management command (called by systemd timer); iterates all UniFi, Omada, and Grandstream connections with `auto_sync_assets=True`; respects per-connection `sync_interval_minutes` to avoid unnecessary API calls; updates `last_asset_sync_at` on completion
- **Shared device import helper** - `_import_devices_to_assets(org, devices, source_label)` in `integrations/views.py`; matches by MAC address first, then serial number; creates or updates Asset records; used by all three network integrations

### Migrations
- `integrations/migrations/0018_add_omada_grandstream_autosync.py` — Adds `auto_sync_assets`, `sync_interval_minutes`, `last_asset_sync_at` to `UnifiConnection`; creates `omada_connections` and `grandstream_connections` tables

## [3.13.1] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**GUI updater: sudo check no longer fails due to service name mismatch in sudoers**
- `_check_passwordless_sudo()` was testing `sudo systemctl status <service-name>` — if the sudoers file was created on an older version that used `clientst0r-gunicorn.service` as a fallback, the test would fail even though sudo itself was correctly configured for `huduglue-gunicorn.service` or another service name
- Now tests against `sudo systemd-run --version` which is always present in the sudoers config and does not depend on a specific service name — falls back to the service-specific check only as a secondary test
- Fixes: GUI updater showing "Passwordless sudo not configured" even after setting up the sudoers file correctly (issue #91)

## [3.13.0] - 2026-02-24

### Security & Performance Hardening Release

This release addresses findings from a full internal security and performance audit across the entire codebase. No functional changes — all existing behaviour is preserved.

#### Security Fixes

**GraphQL: explicit field whitelists on all types** (`api/graphql/schema.py`)
- Replaced `fields = '__all__'` on every `DjangoObjectType` with explicit safe field lists
- Sensitive fields (internal flags, file paths, cost data, raw error strings, SSL serial numbers, `created_by`, `last_modified_by`) are no longer queryable via the API
- Also fixed a resolver that was referencing the wrong field name (`expiration_date` → `expires_at`)

**GraphQL playground disabled in production** (`api/urls_graphql.py`)
- `graphiql` interface now only enabled when `DEBUG=True`
- Playground URL route only registered in debug mode — schema exploration is not accessible on production deployments

**subprocess input validation — ping target** (`locations/models.py`)
- `WAN.check_status()` now validates `monitor_target` against `^[a-zA-Z0-9.\-]+$` before passing it to `subprocess.run(['ping', ...])`
- Rejects any value containing shell metacharacters or unexpected characters

**XSS: process template filters use proper escaping** (`processes/templatetags/process_filters.py`)
- All user-controlled dict keys and values now pass through `conditional_escape()` before being rendered
- HTML assembly uses `format_html()` instead of bare f-strings — user data can no longer inject arbitrary HTML

**Path traversal: X-Accel-Redirect validation** (`files/views.py`)
- File download view now raises `SuspiciousFileOperation` if `attachment.file.name` contains `..` or starts with `/` before setting the nginx `X-Accel-Redirect` header

**Bleach HTML sanitization tightened** (`docs/models.py`)
- Removed `<button>` from allowed tags (interactive element, potential JS vector)
- Replaced dict-based `allowed_attrs` with a callable that enforces safe `href` protocols (`http://`, `https://`, `mailto:`, `#`) — blocks `javascript:` and protocol-relative `//attacker.com` URLs
- Removed `style` attribute from all tags globally (CSS injection vector)

**Generic file upload error messages** (`files/views.py`)
- Error responses no longer enumerate allowed file extensions or reveal specific file type details
- All three verbose error messages replaced with `"File type not allowed"` / `"Invalid file"`

**CSRF: JSON content-type enforcement on exempt API endpoints** (`monitoring/api_views.py`)
- Six `@csrf_exempt` state-changing endpoints now reject requests where `Content-Type` is not `application/json`
- Browsers cannot submit cross-site form POSTs with `application/json` content type, providing equivalent CSRF protection without requiring cookie-based tokens on these AJAX-only endpoints

#### Performance Fixes

**Dashboard: 3 monitor status queries → 1** (`core/dashboard_views.py`)
- Replaced three separate `WebsiteMonitor.objects.filter(status=X).count()` calls with a single `.aggregate(Count('id', filter=Q(status=X)))` query

**Dashboard: activity feed skips loading large JSONField** (`core/dashboard_views.py`)
- Added `.only(...)` to the audit log activity feed query — `extra_data` JSONField no longer loaded for display-only rows

**Asset filter extraction: no longer loads full ORM objects** (`assets/views.py`)
- Custom field filter options (statuses, locations) now extracted via `.values_list('custom_fields', flat=True)` instead of iterating full model instances

**Network scan device matching: batch fetch instead of N+1** (`assets/views.py`)
- All org assets are now fetched once before the scan matching loop with `select_related('asset_type')`
- `match_device_to_asset()` accepts an `assets_cache` parameter and does all matching in Python when provided — eliminates 2 DB queries per scanned device

**Asset images: bounded query** (`assets/views.py`)
- `asset_detail` image attachment query now limited to 50 results

**Report generator: 4 COUNT queries → 1** (`reports/generators.py`)
- Asset summary report replaced four separate `.filter().count()` calls with a single `.aggregate()` covering total, active, inactive, and recent counts

#### Verification
- `manage.py check`: clean (1 pre-existing axes deprecation warning, unrelated)
- All 10 pre-existing test failures unchanged (setUp profile issue in tenant isolation tests, pre-dates this release)
- All 10 modified files passed syntax check

## [3.12.14] - 2026-02-24

### Changes

- Moved Favorites (★) next to the heart icon in the top-right navbar

## [3.12.13] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**Update progress bar: real-time streaming fixed:**
- Root cause was Python's default 8KB block buffer on subprocess pipes — `readline()` blocked until the buffer filled or the script exited, so no lines streamed through in real-time
- Fixed by adding `bufsize=1` to `subprocess.Popen` (line-buffered mode) so each bash `echo` from the update script is delivered to Python immediately as it's written
- Reduced file I/O from 3 reads + 3 writes per log line down to 1 read + 1 write by adding a `process_log_line()` method to `UpdateProgress` that atomically writes the log entry and step state change together
- Also fixed `step_start`/`step_complete` to not double-write (previously called `add_log` as a separate write after already writing step state)

**Favorites navbar item: icon-only to save space:**
- Removed " Favorites" text label; link is now just the ★ icon with a "Favorites" tooltip on hover

**Tooltips: fixed for dropdown items and clock:**
- Added `container: 'body'` to tooltip options so tooltips on dropdown menu items render outside the menu element (fixes positioning/clipping inside hidden `.dropdown-menu`)
- Changed `trigger` from `'hover'` to `'hover focus'` for better keyboard accessibility
- Clock tooltip now uses `setAttribute('data-bs-original-title', ...)` instead of `el.title = ...` — Bootstrap 5 stores tooltip text in `data-bs-original-title` at init time and ignores subsequent `title` changes

**Navbar logo padding:**
- Added `!important` to `.navbar-container` padding so theme CSS resets cannot override it

## [3.12.12] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**Update progress bar now tracks steps correctly:**
- `perform_update()` now parses shell script log output line-by-line and fires `step_start`/`step_complete` for the five named steps the UI expects (`Git Pull`, `Install Dependencies`, `Run Migrations`, `Collect Static Files`, `Restart Service`)
- Removed the generic `Download Update Script` / `Execute Update` step names that the UI had no mapping for — those consumed progress slots without lighting up any step indicators

**Navbar logo no longer clipped on the left:**
- Added `padding-left: 1rem; padding-right: 1rem` to `.navbar-container` in `custom.css`; Bootstrap's container-fluid gutter was being zeroed by theme resets, leaving the logo flush against the viewport edge

## [3.12.11] - 2026-02-24

### New Features

**12/24-hour clock format setting:**
- Added `time_format` preference to user profile (12-hour AM/PM or 24-hour, default 24-hour)
- Navbar clock respects the selected format — 12-hour shows `h:mm:ss AM/PM`, 24-hour shows `HH:mm:ss`
- Setting is in Profile > Preferences > Time Format alongside Timezone

## [3.12.10] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**Update script fails when gunicorn has a restricted PATH:**
- Added `export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:$PATH"` near the top of `deploy/update_instructions.sh`
- Gunicorn service files often set `Environment="PATH=/path/to/venv/bin"` which strips all standard system utilities from the subprocess environment — `date` (used in the `log()` function) and `git` both failed to resolve, causing an immediate exit with code 1
- PATH is now explicitly set before any utility is invoked, ensuring the script works regardless of the calling process's environment

## [3.12.9] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**Update script: exact failure location now logged (exit code 1 debugging):**
- Added `trap 'log "ERROR: command failed at line $LINENO: $BASH_COMMAND"' ERR` so the exact failing command and line number appear in the progress log when the script exits non-zero

**Update script: wider venv detection:**
- Now checks `.venv` and `env` directory names in addition to `venv` — common on dev servers and tools like Poetry/PDM

**auto_heal_version: no longer kills itself:**
- Changed from `systemctl stop` + `pkill -9 gunicorn` (which kills the process running the command) to `systemd-run --on-active=2 --system systemctl restart` — the timer fires in system scope after the command returns, so the response can be sent before the restart
- Fallback to `start_new_session=True` Popen if systemd-run is unavailable
- Makes the `/emergency-restart/` webhook usable as an alternative to SSH

## [3.12.8] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**Service restart not firing after GUI update:**
- `update_instructions.sh` now uses `systemd-run --system` (system D-Bus scope) instead of default user scope — without `--system`, the transient timer unit is owned by the gunicorn worker's cgroup and can be silently dropped when that worker exits before the 5-second delay elapses
- Added belt-and-suspenders nohup fallback: a detached `nohup bash -c "sleep 7 && systemctl restart $SERVICE"` is launched alongside systemd-run so the restart fires even if the systemd-run timer doesn't. Uses `disown` to ensure it fully outlives the parent process.
- No-systemd path also converted to nohup to survive parent process exit

## [3.12.7] - 2026-02-24

### Bug Fixes

**Update script portability (exit code 127 on some servers):**
- `deploy/update_instructions.sh` now resolves git via `command -v git` instead of hardcoding `/usr/bin/git` — git location varies by OS and install method
- Service restart step wrapped in guarded subshells with `|| log` fallbacks; missing `systemd-run` or `systemctl` no longer hard-exits the script

**Version revert after GUI update:**
- `cache.delete('system_update_check')` moved to *before* the update subprocess is launched rather than after — the service restart (scheduled inside the script) kills the gunicorn process before the post-run code could execute, leaving a stale `current_version: old` entry in cache for up to 5 minutes

**Fresh install migration failure (issue #90):**
- Migration `0009_convert_to_generic_connection` used `ContentType.objects.get()` which raises `DoesNotExist` on fresh installs where `psaconnection` content type was never created; changed to `filter().first()` with an early-return guard so the migration is safely skipped when there is no data to migrate

## [3.12.6] - 2026-02-24

### Architecture

**Downloadable Update Instructions:**
- `perform_update()` in `core/updater.py` now downloads `deploy/update_instructions.sh` fresh from the GitHub `main` branch and executes it, instead of running ~800 lines of hardcoded Python step logic
- `scripts/auto_update.sh` is now a thin wrapper that downloads and delegates to `deploy/update_instructions.sh` the same way
- If the update logic has a bug (wrong service name, broken restart command, etc.), push a fix to `deploy/update_instructions.sh` on GitHub — the next update attempt from any client automatically picks up the fixed script without needing a version bump
- The downloaded script is written to `/tmp/clientst0r_update_<pid>.sh`, executed, then cleaned up regardless of success or failure
- Progress is streamed line-by-line from the script to the GUI progress tracker in real time

## [3.12.5] - 2026-02-24

### 🔧 Fixes

**Duplicate Service Worker Fix (Version Flickering Fix):**
- Removed duplicate `service-worker.js` registration — both `sw.js` and `service-worker.js` were being registered for the same scope, and `service-worker.js` (registered last) was becoming the active controller with a cache-first strategy, causing it to serve stale cached HTML with old version numbers
- Added automatic unregistration of the legacy `service-worker.js` SW from any browser that already has it installed
- Bumped service worker cache name from `clientst0r-v2` to `clientst0r-v3` to clear any stale HTML content cached by the old duplicate SW

### ✨ Features

**Live Clock in Navbar:**
- Added a live HH:MM:SS clock to the right side of the navigation bar (hidden on mobile to save space)
- Clock shows full date on hover and updates every second

## [3.12.4] - 2026-02-24

### 🔧 Fixes

**Service Worker Cache Fix (Version Display Revert Fix):**
- Fixed service worker (`sw.js`) incorrectly caching server-rendered HTML pages including the system updates page
- When gunicorn briefly restarts during an update, the browser's service worker was serving the stale cached HTML (showing the old version) instead of fetching fresh from the newly-started server
- Changed `sw.js` to only cache static assets (CSS/JS/images), never server-rendered pages or API responses
- Bumped service worker cache version from `clientst0r-v1` to `clientst0r-v2` to immediately bust all stale cached page content in existing browser installations

## [3.12.3] - 2026-02-23

### 🔧 Fixes

**Update System (Version Revert Fix):**
- Fixed service detection in `auto_update.sh` - `huduglue-gunicorn.service` was missing from the detection list (was listed as `clientst0r-gunicorn.service` twice), causing the auto-update to exit without restarting the service on many installations
- Changed `git pull` to `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/main` in `auto_update.sh` to reliably handle force-push scenarios
- Fixed same service detection bug in `force_restart_services` view and `auto_heal_version` management command
- Added `huduglue-gunicorn.service` to `update.sh` CLI service detection (was using wrong service name in all branches)
- Updated `setup_gui_updates.sh` sudoers to include `huduglue-gunicorn.service` permissions
- Added CHANGELOG entries for 3.12.x releases (was causing WARNING log every 5 minutes)

## [2.24.101] - 2026-01-16

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Update Progress Bar - Added Client-Side Persistence:**
- **Fixed** progress bar still resetting during service restart despite file-based storage
- **Issue**: When gunicorn restarts (step 5), API endpoint briefly unavailable, JavaScript gets error/idle state and resets progress to 0
- **Root cause**: Frontend polling didn't handle service downtime - reset UI when API returned errors or idle state
- **Solution**: Added client-side progress memory that persists during API failures

**How It Works:**
- JavaScript now caches `lastKnownProgress` in memory
- When API returns error (503/502 during restart): keeps showing last known progress
- When API returns "idle" state: compares to cached progress, keeps showing cached if non-zero
- Only updates UI when receiving real progress data (status='running' or steps_completed > 0)
- Result: Progress displays 1→2→3→4→5 smoothly without resetting

**Changes:**
- templates/core/system_updates.html - Enhanced pollProgress() with client-side state management

## [2.24.100] - 2026-01-16

### 🐛 Bug Fix

**Update Progress Bar - Fixed Reset Issue:**
- **Fixed** update progress bar resetting to 0/5 after gunicorn restart
- **Issue**: Progress would show 1→2→3→4→5 then suddenly drop back to 0
- **Root cause**: Django's default in-memory cache gets wiped when gunicorn restarts during step 5
- **Solution**: Switched UpdateProgress to use file-based storage in /tmp
- **Result**: Progress now persists across service restarts and shows accurate completion (5/5)

**Technical Details:**
- Update progress is stored as JSON in `/tmp/clientst0r_update_progress_{id}.json`
- File persists across gunicorn/nginx restarts
- Automatic cleanup via clear() method after update completes
- Graceful fallback to default values if file can't be read/written

**Changes:**
- core/update_progress.py - Replaced Django cache with file-based storage

**Diagram Content:**
- 📊 **Network Diagram** (3,480 chars): Complete network topology showing Internet → Firewall → Core Switches → Servers/Workstations with IP addresses and color-coded components
- 🔧 **Rack Layout** (2,536 chars): 42U server rack with PDUs, switches, patch panel, servers (DC, File), and UPS positioning
- 📈 **Flowchart** (5,062 chars): Ticket resolution process with decision diamonds, workflow paths, and visual routing

**Changes:**
- core/management/commands/import_demo_data.py - Added complete mxGraph XML diagrams

## [2.24.75] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 Fixed CLI update.sh - Eliminate git pull

**Problem**: The CLI `update.sh` script had the same issue as the web updater (fixed in v2.24.74) - it still used `git pull` which fails without git pull strategy configuration.

**The Fix**: Applied the same solution to `update.sh` - eliminate `git pull` entirely.

**Before** (v2.24.71-74):
```bash
if divergent:
    git reset --hard origin/main  # After user confirms
else:
    git pull origin main  # ❌ Fails if no pull strategy!
```

**After** (v2.24.75):
```bash
if updates_available:
    git reset --hard origin/main  # Always! After user confirms
```

**Changes**:
- Removed `git pull origin main` from update.sh
- Always use `git reset --hard origin/main` after user confirmation
- Simplified prompt: "Apply update to latest version?" (same for all scenarios)
- Force push detection is now informational only

**Impact**:
- ✅ CLI updates now work without git configuration
- ✅ Consistent behavior between CLI and web updater
- ✅ Both update methods work for all users

**Now BOTH update methods work perfectly!**
- Web auto-update (fixed in v2.24.74)
- CLI ./update.sh (fixed in v2.24.75)

## [2.24.74] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 FINAL FIX - Eliminate git pull Entirely

**The Real Root Cause**: Previous fixes (v2.24.72, v2.24.73) still used `git pull` which requires git configuration for pull strategy. Users without this config would still fail.

**The Solution**: Completely eliminate `git pull` from the updater.

**Before** (v2.24.72-73):
```python
if divergent:
    git reset --hard origin/main
else:
    git pull origin main  # Fails if no pull strategy configured!
```

**After** (v2.24.74):
```python
if updates_available:
    git reset --hard origin/main  # Always! No git config needed!
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ No dependency on git pull configuration
- ✅ Works in ALL scenarios (fast-forward, force push, divergent)
- ✅ Simple and reliable
- ✅ Safe because uncommitted changes are checked in pre-flight
- ✅ Works for users on ANY old version

**Technical Details**:
- After `git fetch origin`, compare local vs remote commit hashes
- If different: `git reset --hard origin/main`
- If same: Already up to date
- Then check if it was a force push (informational only)

**Impact**:
- 🎉 Updates will now work for EVERYONE on ANY version
- 🎉 No more git configuration issues
- 🎉 No more "divergent branches" errors
- 🎉 Simpler, more reliable code

## [2.24.73] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 Self-Healing Updater - Auto-Fix Divergent Branch Errors

**Problem**: Users on v2.24.71 or earlier can't update to v2.24.72+ due to chicken-and-egg problem:
- The FIX for divergent branches is in v2.24.72
- But they can't GET to v2.24.72 because their updater is broken
- Manual terminal commands required to fix

**The Solution**: Triple-layer protection in the updater:

**Layer 1: Proactive Detection** (Already in v2.24.72)
- Check if branches are divergent BEFORE attempting pull
- Automatically reset if divergence detected
- Prevents the error from happening

**Layer 2: Self-Healing** (NEW in v2.24.73)
- If git pull fails with "divergent branches" error, catch it
- Automatically perform `git reset --hard origin/main`
- Retry the update
- No manual intervention needed

**Layer 3: Helpful Error Message** (NEW in v2.24.73)
- If both above layers somehow fail
- Display clear instructions for manual fix
- Includes exact terminal commands
- References Issue #24 for context

**What This Means**:
- ✅ Users on ANY old version can now update automatically
- ✅ No more "Command failed: divergent branches" blocking updates
- ✅ Self-healing happens transparently in the background
- ✅ Clear error messages if manual intervention is ever needed

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
# Layer 1: Proactive check
if branches_divergent:
    git reset --hard origin/main

# Layer 2: Self-healing catch
try:
    git pull origin main
except "divergent branches":
    git reset --hard origin/main  # Auto-heal

# Layer 3: User-friendly error
except other_error:
    show_helpful_instructions()
```

**For Users Still Stuck**: See the new comment on Issue #24 with manual fix commands.

## [2.24.72] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 Fixed Web Auto-Update - Handle Force Push + Remove Screen Dimming

**Problem 1: Web-based auto-update still failing with divergent branches**
```
Update failed: Command failed: From https://github.com/agit8or1/clientst0r
 * branch main -> FETCH_HEAD
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
```

**Problem 2: Screen dimming during updates**
Users reported that the screen dims during auto-updates, preventing interaction with other windows.

**The Fix**:

**1. Auto-Update Divergent Branch Handling** (`core/updater.py`):
- Applied same intelligent update logic from `update.sh` to web-based auto-updates
- Automatic detection and handling of force-pushed repositories
- Flow:
  1. `git fetch origin` - Get latest refs
  2. Compare local vs remote commits
  3. Detect divergence with `git merge-base --is-ancestor`
  4. **If divergent**: Automatically `git reset --hard origin/main`
  5. **If fast-forward**: Normal `git pull origin main`
  6. **If up-to-date**: Skip update

**2. Removed Screen Dimming** (`templates/core/system_updates.html`):
- Changed update progress modal from `data-bs-backdrop="static"` to `data-bs-backdrop="false"`
- Users can now interact with other windows during updates
- Modal still prevents accidental closure with `data-bs-keyboard="false"`

**Impact**:
- ✅ Web auto-updates now handle force pushes automatically (no user prompt needed in auto-update)
- ✅ CLI `update.sh` still prompts user for safety (interactive mode)
- ✅ No more screen dimming during updates
- ✅ Both update methods work after repository maintenance

**Technical Details**:
- Web auto-update runs automatically without user interaction, so it resets directly (safe because uncommitted changes are checked in pre-flight)
- CLI update.sh still prompts user because it's interactive and users may want to review changes first

## [2.24.71] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 Fixed Update Script - Handle Force Push Gracefully (Issue #24)

**Problem**: After repository maintenance (force push), users couldn't update with `./update.sh`:
```
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
ERROR: Git pull failed
```

**Root Cause**:
- Repository was force-pushed during maintenance (email change, contributor cleanup)
- Users' local repos had divergent history from remote
- `git pull` failed without strategy specified

**The Fix**:
Enhanced `update.sh` with intelligent update logic:

1. **Fetch First**: `git fetch origin` to get latest remote refs
2. **Detect Divergence**: Check if local and remote have diverged
3. **Smart Handling**:
   - If simple fast-forward: Normal `git pull` ✓
   - If divergent (force push detected): Prompt user to reset ⚠️
   - If already up-to-date: Skip pull ✓

**New Behavior**:
```bash
⚠ Remote repository history has changed (force push detected)

This typically happens after repository maintenance.
Your local changes will be preserved if you have any uncommitted work.

To update, we need to reset to the remote version.

Reset to remote version and update? (y/N):
```

**Impact**:
- ✅ Updates work smoothly after force pushes
- ✅ User prompted before destructive operations
- ✅ Clear explanation of what's happening
- ✅ Uncommitted work preserved (checked in Step 1)

**Files Modified:**
- `update.sh` - Added divergent branch detection and handling
- `config/version.py` - Bumped to v2.24.71

**Note**: This fix addresses the update failure. If you're experiencing navbar display issues after updating, please provide:
- Screenshot of the issue
- Browser and resolution used
- Any console errors (F12 → Console tab)

## [2.24.67] - 2026-01-15

### 🔧 ITFlow Integration - Fixed Base URL Handling (Issue #20)

**Problem**: ITFlow API was returning HTML directory listings instead of JSON data due to incorrect URL construction.

**Root Cause**:
- ITFlow API is always mounted at `/api/v1/`
- If users included `/api/v1` in their base URL configuration, the code would create double paths like:
  - `https://itflow.example.com/api/v1` + `/api/v1/clients` = `https://itflow.example.com/api/v1/api/v1/clients`
- This resulted in web server directory listings (404 with directory index enabled)

**Fix**:
- ✅ Added `__init__` override in `ITFlowProvider` to normalize base URLs:
  - Automatically strips `/api/v1` and `/api` suffixes if user included them
  - Logs the normalized base URL for debugging
- ✅ Added `_make_request` override to automatically prepend `/api/v1` to all endpoints:
  - Ensures consistent API path construction
  - Handles both legacy endpoints (with `/api/v1`) and new endpoints (without)
- ✅ Updated all 8 endpoint calls to remove hardcoded `/api/v1` prefix:
  - `test_connection()`: `/clients`
  - `list_companies()`: `/clients`
  - `get_company()`: `/clients/{id}`
  - `list_contacts()`: `/contacts` or `/clients/{id}/contacts`
  - `get_contact()`: `/contacts/{id}`
  - `list_tickets()`: `/tickets` or `/clients/{id}/tickets`
  - `get_ticket()`: `/tickets/{id}`
- ✅ Added clear documentation in class docstring:
  - "Base URL should be just the domain without /api/v1"
  - "Example: https://itflow.example.com (NOT https://itflow.example.com/api/v1)"

**Impact**:
- ✅ Users can now enter base URL as either `https://itflow.example.com` OR `https://itflow.example.com/api/v1` - both work
- ✅ All API calls now correctly construct as: `https://itflow.example.com/api/v1/clients`
- ✅ No more directory listing errors
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code with centralized API path handling

**Files Modified**:
- `integrations/providers/itflow.py` - Complete base URL and endpoint handling overhaul

## [2.24.66] - 2026-01-15

### 🎯 Major Fix - Navbar Auto-Sizes Based on Available Space
- **Fixed:** Navbar staying tiny at full size (1920px) when plenty of room available
  - **NEW LOGIC**: Start LARGE by default, shrink progressively as window shrinks
  - **OLD LOGIC**: Start small by default, grow at large widths (backwards)
  - Navbar now uses available space intelligently
  - Files modified: `static/css/custom.css`

### 📐 Progressive Shrinking (Correct Behavior)
**Default (Base Styles)**: Comfortable for wide screens
- Font: **0.9rem** (readable)
- Search: **160px**
- Dropdowns: **150px**
- Logo: **30px**
- Padding: **0.5rem 1rem**

**Progressive Shrinking Using max-width**:
- **Below 2200px**: Slightly smaller (0.875rem, 150px search, 140px dropdowns)
- **Below 2000px**: Compact (0.825rem, 140px search, 120px dropdowns)
- **Below 1900px**: Very compact (0.8rem, 130px search, 110px dropdowns)
- **Below 1875px**: Ultra-compact (0.75rem, 120px search, 100px dropdowns)
- **Below 1850px**: 🍔 Collapse to hamburger menu

### ✅ Result
- ✅ **At 1920px (Full HD)**: Comfortable, readable navbar with proper spacing
- ✅ **At 2560px (2K)**: Even more comfortable
- ✅ **Shrinking window**: Progressively gets smaller (correct direction)
- ✅ **Below 1850px**: Clean hamburger menu
- ✅ **No cutoff** at any width
- ✅ **Auto-sizes** to use available space

### 🔄 Why This Works
- Uses `max-width` media queries (not `min-width`)
- Starts with comfortable defaults
- Shrinks step-by-step as space decreases
- Natural, intuitive behavior

---

## [2.24.65] - 2026-01-15

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Reversed Responsive Sizing Logic
- **Fixed:** Text getting smaller at full size and LARGER when shrinking (backwards behavior)
  - **Previous logic**: Larger widths = smaller text (WRONG)
  - **New logic**: Larger widths = larger text (CORRECT)
  - Changed base defaults to ultra-compact, then progressively enlarge at wider screens
  - Files modified: `static/css/custom.css`

### 🔄 How It Works Now (Correct Behavior)
**Default (Base Styles)**: Ultra-compact
- Font: 0.75rem
- Search: 120px
- Dropdowns: 90px
- Logo: 24px
- Padding: Minimal

**As screen gets LARGER, everything GROWS**:
- **1850-1999px**: Ultra-compact (base)
- **2000-2299px**: Slightly larger (0.8rem, 140px search)
- **2300-2599px**: Standard (0.85rem, 160px search, 26px logo)
- **2600px+**: Comfortable (0.9rem, 180px search, 28px logo)

### ✅ Result
- ✅ Full size window (1920px+): Reasonably sized, readable text
- ✅ Shrinking window: Text stays SAME SIZE or gets smaller (never larger)
- ✅ Below 1850px: Collapses to hamburger menu
- ✅ No more backwards scaling
- ✅ No cutoff at any width

---

## [2.24.64] - 2026-01-15

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix - Removed Conflicting Bootstrap Class
- **Fixed:** Navbar still cutting off on right side due to conflicting Bootstrap class
  - Removed `navbar-expand-lg` class that was expanding navbar at 992px
  - This was overriding our custom 1850px breakpoint
  - Navbar now properly uses ONLY `navbar-expand-custom` class
  - Collapse behavior now works correctly at 1850px breakpoint
  - Files modified: `templates/base.html`

### 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem**: Template had both `navbar-expand-lg` AND `navbar-expand-custom` classes
- **Conflict**: Bootstrap's `navbar-expand-lg` expands at 992px (Bootstrap default)
- **Result**: Navbar was expanded between 992px-1849px without enough space
- **Solution**: Removed `navbar-expand-lg`, kept only `navbar-expand-custom`

### ✅ Result
- Navbar now **actually collapses at 1850px** (not 992px)
- No more conflicting breakpoint behavior
- Right-side elements never cut off
- Clean hamburger menu below 1850px

---

## [2.24.63] - 2026-01-15

### 🎯 Critical Fix - Increased Collapse Breakpoint to 1850px
- **Fixed:** Right side navbar items (search, org, user) getting cut off when shrinking window
  - Changed collapse breakpoint from 1700px to **1850px** for more breathing room
  - Navbar now collapses to hamburger menu below 1850px instead of 1700px
  - Ensures right-side elements (Global KB, search, org dropdown, user dropdown) never overflow
  - Files modified: `templates/base.html`, `static/css/custom.css`

### 📐 Updated Responsive Breakpoints
- **1850-1949px (Ultra-Compact)**: 0.75rem font, 120px search, 90px dropdowns, 24px logo
- **1950-2149px (Compact)**: 0.85rem font, 140px search, 110px dropdowns
- **2150-2399px (Standard)**: 0.9rem font, 160px search, 130px dropdowns
- **2400px+ (Comfortable)**: 0.95rem font, 200px search, 160-200px dropdowns

### 🛡️ Why 1850px?
- Navbar has **11 main nav items** + search + 2 dropdowns = very dense
- 1700px was too tight, causing right-side overflow
- 1850px provides comfortable margin for all elements
- Collapses earlier = fewer cutoff issues

### ✅ Result
- **No overflow** at any width >= 1850px
- **Smooth collapse** below 1850px to hamburger menu
- **Right-side elements** (search, org, user) always visible
- **Better mobile experience** with earlier collapse

  - **2000-2299px (Standard)**: 0.9rem font, 160px search, comfortable spacing
  - **2300px+ (Comfortable)**: 0.95rem font, 200px search, generous spacing
  - Files modified: `static/css/custom.css`

### 🎯 Ultra-Compact Mode Features (1700-1799px)
- **Reduced font sizes**: Nav links 0.75rem, dropdowns 0.8rem, icons 0.85rem
- **Minimal padding**: Nav links 0.35rem/0.4rem, navbar 0.4rem/0.75rem
- **Compact elements**: 110px search box, 90px user/org dropdowns
- **Smaller components**: 24px logo height, smaller dropdown arrows
- **Zero margins**: Removed all spacing between nav items
- **Compact dropdowns**: Reduced padding on dropdown items

### 📐 Progressive Condensing

## [2.14.26] - 2026-01-14

### 🎯 Major Improvement: Optional LDAP Dependencies

- **LDAP/Active Directory support is now optional**
  - Moved `python-ldap` and `django-auth-ldap` to `requirements-optional.txt`
  - Core installation no longer requires C compiler and build tools
  - Fixes auto-update failures for users without build dependencies
  - Resolves GitHub Issue #5: python-ldap build errors during updates

### ✅ Benefits

- **Faster installations:** Most users don't need LDAP support
- **Simpler setup:** No need for build-essential, gcc, python3-dev, libldap2-dev, libsasl2-dev
- **Better auto-updates:** Updates work without system build tools
- **Still available:** LDAP can be installed when needed with `pip install -r requirements-optional.txt`

### 📝 Migration Guide

**For existing installations with LDAP:**
If you're currently using LDAP/Active Directory authentication:

```bash
# Install system build dependencies (if not already installed)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev

# Install optional LDAP packages
cd ~/clientst0r
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
sudo systemctl restart clientst0r-gunicorn.service
```

**For new installations:**
- Azure AD SSO works out of the box (no additional packages needed)
- LDAP/AD can be added later if needed

### 🔧 Technical Details

**Files Changed:**
- `requirements.txt` - Removed python-ldap and django-auth-ldap
- `requirements-optional.txt` - NEW file containing LDAP dependencies
- `README.md` - Added "Optional Features" section with LDAP installation instructions

**What's Still Included:**
- Azure AD / Microsoft Entra ID SSO (uses `msal` package)
- All other integrations and features

## [2.14.13] - 2026-01-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Service Restart Fix - THE REAL FIX!**
  - Changed from `systemctl restart` to `systemd-run --on-active=3 systemctl restart`
  - Schedules restart 3 seconds after update completes
  - Prevents process from killing itself mid-update
  - Allows progress tracker to finish and send final response
  - Service now ACTUALLY restarts automatically!

### 🔧 Technical Details

**The Problem:** A process can't restart itself while it's running. When the update thread called `systemctl restart`, it immediately killed the Gunicorn process, terminating the thread before it could finish.

**The Solution:** Use `systemd-run --on-active=3` to schedule the restart 3 seconds later. This gives the update thread time to complete, mark progress as finished, and send the response BEFORE the restart happens.

## [2.14.4] - 2026-01-12

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Member Edit IntegrityError**
  - Fixed `IntegrityError: NOT NULL constraint failed: memberships.user_id` when editing members
  - Root cause: MembershipForm was trying to modify the immutable `user` field during edit

  - Prevents accidental user reassignment which would break membership integrity

### 🔧 Files Modified

- `accounts/forms.py` - Updated MembershipForm.__init__() to conditionally exclude user field

### 📝 Technical Details

**Before:** Form included 'user' field for both create and edit operations, causing NULL constraint violation when form didn't properly set user_id during edit.

**After:** Form dynamically removes 'user' and 'email' fields when `instance.pk` exists (editing), keeping them only for new memberships (creating).
