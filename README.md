## 🚀 Quick Start

### One-Line Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Client St0r:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agit8or1/clientst0r.git && cd clientst0r && bash install.sh
```

This automated installer will:
- ✅ Install all prerequisites (Python 3.12, pip, venv, MariaDB server & client)
- ✅ Create virtual environment and install dependencies
- ✅ Generate secure encryption keys automatically
- ✅ Create `.env` configuration file
- ✅ Setup database and user
- ✅ Create log directory
- ✅ Run migrations
- ✅ Create superuser account
- ✅ Collect static files
- ✅ **Start production server automatically** (Gunicorn with systemd)
- ✅ **Configure auto-update permissions** (sudoers for one-click web updates)

**When the installer finishes, your server is RUNNING and ready to use!**

### Smart Detection

The installer automatically detects existing installations and offers:

1. **Upgrade/Update** - Pull latest code, run migrations, restart service (zero downtime)
2. **System Check** - Verify all components are working properly
3. **Clean Install** - Remove everything and reinstall from scratch
4. **Exit** - Leave existing installation untouched

No manual cleanup needed! The installer handles everything.

### Web-Based Auto-Update (NEW in 2.14.21!)

Once installed, you can update Client St0r **directly from the web interface**:

1. Navigate to **System Settings → System Updates**
2. Click **"Check for Updates Now"** to detect new versions
3. Click **"Apply Update"** when an update is available
4. Watch real-time progress through all 5 steps:
   - Step 1: Git Pull
   - Step 2: Install Dependencies
   - Step 3: Run Migrations
   - Step 4: Collect Static Files
   - Step 5: Restart Service
5. Page automatically reloads with the new version (20-30 seconds total)

**No SSH access required!** Non-technical users can update safely from the web interface.

**System Requirements:**
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended)
- Internet connection for package installation

### Optional Features

#### LDAP/Active Directory Integration

By default, Client St0r installs with Azure AD SSO support but **without** LDAP/Active Directory. This is because LDAP requires C compilation and system libraries.

**If you need LDAP/AD support**, install it after the main installation:

```bash
# Install system build dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev

# Install LDAP Python packages
cd ~/clientst0r
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
sudo systemctl restart clientst0r-gunicorn.service
```

**Note:** Azure AD SSO does **not** require these packages. LDAP is only needed for on-premises Active Directory or other LDAP servers.

#### Mobile App (iOS & Android)

Client St0r includes a native React Native mobile app for iOS and Android devices.

**Features:**
- 📱 Native iOS and Android apps
- 🔐 Secure token-based authentication
- 📊 Dashboard with quick stats
- 💼 Asset management on the go
- 🔒 Password vault access
- 📚 Document browsing
- 🌙 Dark mode optimized for mobile
- 🔄 Real-time sync via GraphQL API

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI
- Client St0r backend with GraphQL enabled

**Setup:**

```bash
# 1. Install GraphQL dependencies on backend
cd ~/clientst0r
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-graphql.txt
sudo systemctl restart clientst0r-gunicorn.service

# 2. Set up mobile app
cd ~/clientst0r/mobile-app
npm install

# 3. Configure API URL
# Edit app.json and set your Client St0r server URL

# 4. Start development server
npm start

# 5. Run on device
# - iOS: Press 'i' or run: npm run ios
# - Android: Press 'a' or run: npm run android
```

**For complete mobile app documentation, see [mobile-app/README.md](mobile-app/README.md)**
